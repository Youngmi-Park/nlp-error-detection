dearest teach me so to pour outgratitude as thou dust good
musclemens and guyords throw curchefs atd a smile and half no ruth for any weeping
but thou art not such a lover my beloved
thou can't wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late
i think all who hath loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine
oh to shoot my soul's full meaning indto future hers that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endurers from life that disappears
then i long tried by natural ills received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrim staff gave out green bleas with morning doomed impearal
i love thee freely as men strive for riht i loved teep purely as they turned from prays
i loved thee with the passion put to yuse in my old grees and with my childhood's faith
i loved the with a love ie seemed to lose with my lost saints i loved thee with the breath smile teared of all my life and if god toose i shall but love the better after death
