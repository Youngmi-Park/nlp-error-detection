1188-133604-0001	the united every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorests sometimes as kirus scuruss
1188-133604-0002	by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the curoscurest devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light the colorests have for their function the attainment of beauty by rangement of the divisions of light
1188-133604-0003	my first in principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of lang portions of distinct hue side by side
1188-133604-0004	some of the touches indeed when the tenteras been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops er pands so that the pigment might crystalize hard at the edge

1188-133604-0008	for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock rob in this to be read and a bagrass plot to be green and the best skill fart is an instantly seizing on the manofold deliciousness of light which you can only seeise by precision of instintaneous touch
1188-133604-0009	now you will see in these studies that the moment the whit is inclosed properly and harmonize with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds and the round window will tell as jeels if they are gradated justly
1188-133604-0010	but in this viniear cappit from turner you hade the two principles brought out perfectly
1188-133604-0011	they are beyond all other works than i know existing dependent for their effect on mose subdued tones their favourite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper
1188-133604-0012	it may be that a great colouralest will use his utmost force of colar as a singer his full power of voice but loud ord lo the virtueis in both cases always in refinement never in loudnss
1188-133604-0013	it must remember be one or the other
1188-133604-0014	do not therefore think that the gothic schools n easy one
1188-133604-0015	the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or t least only in such mister faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
1188-133604-0016	this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact your producing jewelers work rather than pictures
1188-133604-0017	thet astyle as restrained or severe does not mean that it is also a runius
1188-133604-0018	in all earrly gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and regidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid ropose of classic art
1188-133604-0019	the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely child ish in failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
1188-133604-0020	but observe you can only do this on one condition that ob striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
1188-133604-0021	it will be holly impossible for you to retain the tranquility of temperant felicity of faith necessary from noble purice painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and pece of practical life
1188-133604-0022	you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
1188-133604-0023	the colorest says first of all as my delicious paracae was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black and then as the question can i round him off even though he is black and make him slimy and yet springig and close down clodded like a poll of black blood on the earth all the same
1188-133604-0024	nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art then the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way oll things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
1188-133604-0025	you know i've just been telling you how the school materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire
1188-133604-0026	here 's an equally typical greek school landscape by wilson lost wholy and golden nest the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees were towers and no care for color whatsoever perfectly deceptive an marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist a pollo and the pifhon

1188-133604-0028	while then last here is turns greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and thin the invelopment of it wiuth cloud and fire
1188-133604-0029	only there are two sorts of cloud in far
1188-133604-0030	he knows them both

1188-133604-0038	but now here is a subject of which you will wonder it first why turnor drew it at all
1188-133604-0039	it as no beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesquedness and all its lines are cramped and poor
1188-133604-0040	the crampness in the poverty are all intended
1188-133604-0041	it is a gleaner bringing down her one sheef of corn to an old water mill it self mossi and rent scarcely able to get it stones to tirn
1188-133604-0042	the scene is absolutely arcadian

121-127105-0023	let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
121-127105-0024	poar dogbess before his death when it was in sighe committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushe to little circle of the night of the forth
121-127105-0025	the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a range of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
121-127105-0026	the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had in a manner fe gun
121-127105-0027	he had for his own town residence of big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home and old family place in essex that he wished for immediately to proceed
121-127105-0028	the arkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took aball as time
121-127105-0029	they were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
121-127105-0030	i don't anticipate
121-127105-0031	she was young i'm tried nervous it was a vision of serious duties ind little company for really great loneliness
121-127105-0032	hehs but that's just tha beauty of her passion
121-127105-0033	it was the beauty of it
121-127105-0034	its sound a dull thet sounded strange and all the moresor because of his main condition which was
121-127105-0035	she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment thisburdent delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
121-127105-0036	but it was that all her reward whone of the ladies asked
1221-135766-0000	how strange at seemed to the sad woman as she watched the groth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that throwh its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
1221-135766-0001	god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of morals and to be finely a blessed soul in heaven
1221-135766-0002	yet these thoughts affected hester prin less with hope than apprehension
1221-135766-0003	the child had a native grace which does not embariably coexist with faultless beauty it's a tire however simple always impresse the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
1221-135766-0004	this outward newt ability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life
1221-135766-0005	hester putd only account for the child's character and even then most vagally end imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
1221-135766-0006	there were now alluminated by the morning radionce of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whor awind
1221-135766-0007	hester prin nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of eiring on the side of undue soverity
1221-135766-0008	mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant and mortality that was committed to her charge
1221-135766-0009	as to any other kind of discipline whether address to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordnace with the kaprice that rolled the moment
1221-135766-0010	it was a look so intelligent yet anexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanyed by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not hele questioning a such moments whether pearl was a human child
1221-135766-0011	beholding it haster was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elph in the flight which she envariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
1221-135766-0012	brooding over all these matters the mother felt like wone who has a voke to spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
1221-135766-0013	parl was a born outcast of the inventile world
1221-135766-0014	parl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance

1221-135767-0000	hester print went one day to the mansion of governor belling ham with a pair of bloves which she had frnged and emboidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused the sformer ruler to descend a step for two from the highest rank he still held and honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
1221-135767-0001	another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves inpelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the suttlement
1221-135767-0002	at that epic of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and a fhar less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state
1221-135767-0003	the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only cause a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature
1221-135767-0004	we have spoken of pearl's rich and luxjoriant beauty a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black
1221-135767-0005	it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter in dowled with life
1221-135767-0006	the mother herself as if the red ignomine were so deeply scorched andto her brain that all her conceptions a soned its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid in genuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
1221-135767-0007	but in truth for al was the one as well as the other and only inconsequence of that identity had haster contrive so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
1221-135767-0008	come therefore and let us sling mud at them
1221-135767-0009	but perl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the not of her enemies and put them all to flight
1221-135767-0010	she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
1221-135767-0011	it was further decorated with strange and seemingly capolistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when nowly laid on and had now grown hard and doorable for the admiration of after times
1221-135767-0012	they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projecton of the adofice in both of which were latis windows the wooden shutters to close over them at need
1221-135767-0013	lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prin gave a summons which was answered by one of the governors bond servants a free borne english man but now a seven years slave

1221-135767-0017	on the table and tokened at the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behind stood a large puter tankered at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy rumnant of a recent draft of aile
1221-135767-0018	little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering frontous piece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breast plate
1221-135767-0019	mother cried she i see you here look look
1221-135767-0020	and truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it
1221-135767-0021	fearl accordingly ran to the bowindow at the further end of the hall and looked along the viste of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and invetor attempt at shrubery
1221-135767-0022	but the proprietor appeared already to have reelinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
1221-135767-0023	there were a few rose bushes however an a number of apple trees probably the descendents of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the penincula that half mithological personage who rides through our early annals seaded on the back of a ball
1221-135767-0024	pearl seing the rose bushes began to cry for our red rose and would not be passified
1284-1180-0000	he were blue silk stockings blue nee pans with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braded with gold
1284-1180-0001	his hat had a peaked crown in a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells tha tinkled when he moved
1284-1180-0002	instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turnover tops and as blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid
1284-1180-0003	for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful and of os in which they lived
1284-1180-0004	when they were outside ung simply laphed the door and started up the path
1284-1180-0005	no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
1284-1180-0006	at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the monchkins from the country of the gillickans the path divided
1284-1180-0007	he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was there nearest neighbour
1284-1180-0008	all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and adnoon unk and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
1284-1180-0009	then they started on again and two hours later came an sight of the house of doctor pipped
1284-1180-0010	all conocted the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all lin blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
1284-1180-0011	i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
1284-1180-0012	we have come from a fire lontlely er place than this alone leer place
1284-1180-0013	and you must be ojo the unlucky she added
1284-1180-0014	oh jo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life
1284-1180-0015	where travelling replied ojo and les stoff it your house just to rest and werefresh ourselves
1284-1180-0016	the woman seemed thoughtful
1284-1180-0017	and one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling in steaming at a great rate
1284-1180-0018	it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i making it fror my good wife margaralot who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own
1284-1180-0019	you must know said margalot when they were allseated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mumbe the witch who use to leave in the country of te gillikins to the north of here
1284-1180-0020	the first loct we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
1284-1180-0021	i think the next glass cat then magician makes well have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mise and they prove of some use to us
1284-1180-0022	i my fraid i don't know much about the land of us
1284-1180-0023	yousee i ave lived allmy life with a nonkey the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
1284-1180-0024	that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in sympathetic tone
1284-1180-0025	i think i must show you my patch work girl said margalout laughing at the boys ostonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
1284-1180-0026	but first i will tell you that from many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the house work and to cok the meals and wash the dishes
1284-1180-0027	yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
1284-1180-0028	a bed quilt made af patches of different kinds and colours of cloth onleat ly so together
1284-1180-0029	sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
1284-1180-0030	when i found id i said to myself that it would do nicely fror my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colours would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchgins are
1284-1180-0031	at the emerald city where our princess alsimalives green is the popular color
1284-1180-0032	i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
1284-1181-0000	oh jo wexamined this carious contrivance with wonder
1284-1181-0001	margalot had first made the girls form from the patch work quiled and then she had dressed it with tha patch work skirt and in apron with pockets in it using the same game material throughout
1284-1181-0002	the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
1284-1181-0003	the hair was af brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat brains
1284-1181-0004	gold is the most common metal in the land of os and is used for many purposes because it is soft andpliable
1284-1181-0005	no i forgot anl the bout the brains exclaimed the woman
1284-1181-0006	well that may be true agreed margaloc but on the contary a servat with twoo much brains as sure to become in de pendent in high ind mighty and feel above her work
1284-1181-0007	she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
1284-1181-0008	i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in tha servant
1284-1181-0009	she ran to her husband side at once and helped him lift the fore cattles from the fire
1284-1181-0010	their contents had all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
1284-1181-0011	very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it alltogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
1284-1181-0012	no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
1284-1181-0013	oh jo became ma bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
1284-1181-0014	he selected a small gold bottle with e pepperbox top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes
1284-1181-0015	most people talked twoo much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little
1284-1181-0016	i am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe with a crookin stem and began to smoke
1284-1181-0017	the wizard of as polised to be a humbug a new no matic at all has been taking lessons of glenda and om told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is nearly the assistant of the great source eris
1284-1181-0018	in truly is asserted the magician
1284-1181-0019	i know use them as ortamental statuary in my guarden
1284-1181-0020	dear me wat a chatterboxer getting to be un rermarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment
1284-1181-0021	asked the voice in scornful accents
1284-134647-0000	the grateful applause of the clergy has consequated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest
1284-134647-0001	the edict of milane the great charter of toleration had confirmed to eath individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion
1284-134647-0002	but thiss inestimable privilege was soon violated with a knowledge of truth the emperor embibe the maxims of persecution and the sex which dissented from the catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity
1284-134647-0003	constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderates o arities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation
1284-134647-0004	some of the penal regulations were copied from the enics of dicletion and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who houd fell the hand of appression and pleated for the rights of humanity
1284-134647-0005	they asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the opostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of the ourope and asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the perogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved in violet the integrity of their faith and discipline
1284-134647-0006	bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the domatists
1284-134647-0007	presscribe why the sivgle indeclesiastical powers of the empire the downantist still maintained in some provinces particularly in ti midia their uperior numbers and four hundred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate
1320-122612-0000	since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savages ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
1320-122612-0001	the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shilting a strong and clear light in the forest when the travellers resumed their journey
1320-122612-0002	after proceeding a few miles the progress of howki who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
1320-122612-0003	he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross he rivulat without attentively considering the quantity the valocity and the color of its waters
1320-122612-0004	distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of chingach goko frequent and earnest
1320-122612-0005	yet here are we with an a short range of the sceroons and not a sign of a trail have recrossed
1320-122612-0006	let us retrece our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes
1320-122612-0007	chin got gook had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
1320-122612-0008	the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
1320-122612-0009	it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
1320-122612-0010	see said unchas pointing north an south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest
1320-122612-0011	if a rock or a rivilat or a bit of earth harder than comman severed the links of the clue they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
1320-122612-0012	extinguished brands were lying around a spring the awfuls of a dear were scattered about the place and the trees wore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
1320-122612-0013	a circle of a few hundred feet an sircumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
1320-122612-0014	the examination however resulted in no discovery
1320-122612-0015	the whole party crowded to the spot where uncaspointed out the impression of a mocuson in the moist illuvion
1320-122612-0016	run back on coston bring me the size of the singer's foot
1320-122617-0000	notwithstanding the high resolution of howkay he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to encur
1320-122617-0001	in his return to the camp his acute and practiced o intellects were intently engaged in divising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree in ferior to his own
1320-122617-0002	in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of bailem's as to speak he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
1320-122617-0003	there was something in his air and demanner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
1320-122617-0004	the ingenious hawky who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
1320-122617-0005	the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
1320-122617-0006	can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to down upon him
1320-122617-0007	come com returned hocki an casing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
1320-122617-0008	the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed
1320-122617-0009	i greatly morned that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly hym can you lead me to him
1320-122617-0010	the task will not be difficult return david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase the mitigate his unhappy fortunes
1320-122617-0011	the lodgein which uncus was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
1320-122617-0012	four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison o uncus wary but close observers of the manner of their captive
1320-122617-0013	delivered an astrong tone of a cent announced the gratification the savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness ind an enemy so long hated and so much feared
1320-122617-0014	they drew back a little from the entrance and motion to the supposed conjurer to enter
1320-122617-0015	but the bear instead of obeying maintained the seat of had taken and growled
1320-122617-0016	the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow up on his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hand he received they must stand further off
1320-122617-0017	then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
1320-122617-0018	it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cooquery
1320-122617-0019	onkus occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful withs
1320-122617-0020	the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
1320-122617-0021	what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer is is good as nothing
1320-122617-0022	the delawares are children of the tortise and they outstrippe the deer
1320-122617-0023	oncus who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled ind placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
1320-122617-0024	but hawk y who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself tan to his companion
1320-122617-0025	so onchus you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
1320-122617-0026	well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention
1320-122617-0027	as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turne to daven and gave him his parting instructions
1320-122617-0028	my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust as greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettle that so direct and attack on his menhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
1320-122617-0029	if you are not then knocked on the head youre being a non compasor will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
1320-122617-0030	so thoose for yourself to make a rush or terry here
1320-122617-0031	bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
1320-122617-0032	keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out seddenly and one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
1320-122617-0033	if however they take your scoup as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
1320-122617-0034	hold said david prceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
1320-122617-0035	then heving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
1320-122617-0036	god bless you friend i do believe your send is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping a turnity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation
1320-122617-0037	the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the others features is he afraid
1320-122617-0038	will the herens here his groans
1320-122617-0039	the moheacan started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
1320-122617-0040	he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of chries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
1320-122617-0041	ongess cast a skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
1580-141083-0000	i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
1580-141083-0001	i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrol belegitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
1580-141083-0002	my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
1580-141083-0003	without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely antidiness he was an incomfortable man
1580-141083-0004	i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
1580-141083-0005	i was absent rether more than an hour
1580-141083-0006	the only dupikat which existed so far as i knew it was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who was looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
1580-141083-0007	the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
1580-141083-0008	the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
1580-141083-0009	they all turn ov was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
1580-141083-0010	i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair whill i made a most careful examination of the room
1580-141083-0011	a broken tip of led was lying there also
1580-141083-0012	not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black do or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
1580-141083-0013	above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
1580-141083-0014	to the best of my belief they were rolled up
1580-141083-0015	did any one know that these proofs would be there no one saved the printer
1580-141083-0016	i was in such a hurri to come to you you left your door open
1580-141083-0017	so it seems to me
1580-141083-0018	now mister sulmbs at your disposal
1580-141083-0019	above wore three students one on each story
1580-141083-0020	then he pproached it and standing on tipto with his neck craned he looked into the room
1580-141083-0021	there is no opening except the one paitine said our learned guide
1580-141083-0022	i am afraid there are no signs here said he
1580-141083-0023	one could hardly hope for any upon so dria day
1580-141083-0024	you left him in a chair you say which thair by the window there
1580-141083-0025	the man entered and took the papers shed by shet from the central table
1580-141083-0026	as a matter of fact he could not said solmes for i entered by the side door
1580-141083-0027	how long with a taken to do that using every possible contraction acquarter of an hour not less
1580-141083-0028	then he tassed it down and seized the next
1580-141083-0029	he was in the midst of that when youre return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
1580-141083-0030	mister salmas was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information
1580-141083-0031	homs held out a small chip with the letters an an and the space of clear wood after them you see
1580-141083-0032	what's a ni have always done you and injustice there are others
1580-141083-0033	i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polishe surface no i see nothing
1580-141083-0034	as homes drew the curtain i was aware from some little regidity and anlertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
1580-141083-0035	holms turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hello what is this
1580-141083-0036	homes hut ed out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
1580-141083-0037	what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
1580-141083-0038	i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stare and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
1580-141083-0039	and they are all in for the examination yes
1580-141083-0040	one heartly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
1580-141083-0041	let us he the suspicions i will look after the proofs
1580-141083-0042	my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
1580-141083-0043	the top floor belongs to males mcclerin
1580-141083-0044	i do not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
1580-141083-0045	he was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
1580-141083-0046	but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times
1580-141083-0047	did you look at these papers on the table
1580-141083-0048	how came you to leave the key in the door
1580-141083-0049	any one in the room could get out yes sir
1580-141083-0050	i have really don't think he knew much about it mister holmes
1580-141083-0051	only for a minute or so
1580-141083-0052	oh i would not venture to say sir
1580-141083-0053	you haven't seen any of them no sir
1580-141084-0000	it was the indian whose dark silouett appeared suddenly upon his blind
1580-141084-0001	he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
1580-141084-0002	the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
1580-141084-0003	no names please said holmes as we knocked at gilchris door
1580-141084-0004	of course he did not realize that it was y who was nocking but nonetheless his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious
1580-141084-0005	that is very important aitd homes
1580-141084-0006	you don't seem to realize the position
1580-141084-0007	to morrow as the examination
1580-141084-0008	i can ot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
1580-141084-0009	it is possible that i may be an a position then to indicate some course of action
1580-141084-0010	i will take the black clar with me alsor the pennil cuttings good bye
1580-141084-0011	when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
1580-141084-0012	the fou moute fellow at the top
1580-141084-0013	he is the one with the worst record
1580-141084-0014	why benister the servant what's his game in the matter
1580-141084-0015	he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
1580-141084-0016	my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignation
1580-141084-0017	no good my dear watson
1580-141084-0018	i think so you have formed a conclusion
1580-141084-0019	yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
1580-141084-0020	look at that he held out his hand
1580-141084-0021	on the palm were three little pyramids of black dohy clay
1580-141084-0022	and one more this morning
1580-141084-0023	in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the colprit to compete for the valuable scholarship
1580-141084-0024	he could hardly stand still so great was his mental egitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched think heaven that you have come
1580-141084-0025	you know him i think so
1580-141084-0026	if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
1580-141084-0027	no sir certainly not
1580-141084-0028	tere was no man sir
1580-141084-0029	his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister and the farther corner
1580-141084-0030	just close the door said homes
1580-141084-0031	we want to know mister gilchrist how you and honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
1580-141084-0032	for a moment gil christ with upraised hand tried to control his riving features
1580-141084-0033	come come said holme's kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
1580-141084-0034	well i'll don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you know and justice
1580-141084-0035	he could examine the papers ind his own office
1580-141084-0036	the hindian i also thought nothing of
1580-141084-0037	when i approached your room i examined the window
1580-141084-0038	no one less than that would have a chance
1580-141084-0039	i entered and i took you into my confidence as to this suggestions of the side table
1580-141084-0040	he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are where with several sharp spikes
1580-141084-0041	no harm would have been done had ad not been that as he passed your door he prceived the keey which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
1580-141084-0042	a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
1580-141084-0043	he put his shoes on the table
1580-141084-0044	gloves said the young man
1580-141084-0045	suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
1580-141084-0046	hove i told the truth mister gilgrust
1580-141084-0047	i have a letter here mister solmes which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
1580-141084-0048	it would be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since syou were left in the room and must have locked the door when you en out
1580-141084-0049	it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
1580-141084-0050	if mister solm saw them the game was up
1995-1826-0000	in the debate between the singiers societies her defense of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
1995-1826-0001	the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and miled climate she was not a verse to charleston or new orleans
1995-1826-0002	john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
1995-1826-0003	better go he had counseld antentiously
1995-1826-0004	might learn something useful down there
1995-1826-0005	but john there's no society just elementary work
1995-1826-0006	been looking up toomb's county
1995-1826-0007	fine some crustwells there big plantations raded it two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
1995-1826-0008	some others too bid cottond county
1995-1826-0009	hou ought to know john if i teach negroes else scarcely see much of people in my own class
1995-1826-0010	at any rate i say go
1995-1826-0011	here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused oldors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable
1995-1826-0012	she wonted a glance of the new books in periodicals and talk of grate ful anthropies ind reforms
1995-1826-0013	so for the hundredh times she was thinking today as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
1995-1826-0014	cotton she bassed
1995-1826-0015	she had almost forgotten that it was here with in touch and sight
1995-1826-0016	the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered an murmured before her sretching awit to the northward
1995-1826-0017	it miy be a bit of poor try here and there but most of this place was such desperate prose
1995-1826-0018	her regards shifted to the green stocks and leaves again and she started to move away
1995-1826-0019	cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boyse she said rather primly
1995-1826-0020	miss taylor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remarked seemed called four
1995-1826-0021	don't know will ave all things in wouldly commented miss taylor letter re bornin cotton and o well as much as to ask what's the use she turned again to go
1995-1826-0022	i suppose though it's too early for them then came the explosion
1995-1826-0023	googles don't grow on to tops sadvines but on the ground o new ords like yems is that so
1995-1826-0024	the golden fleece it's the silver fleece he harkened
1995-1826-0025	sometime you tell me please won't you
1995-1826-0026	now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even mat she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing taughtme
1995-1836-0000	the honorable chales smith miss sara's brother was walking swiftly up down from mister easterley's wall street office and his face was pale
1995-1836-0001	at last the cotton combine was to all appearances in assured fact and he was slated for the senate
1995-1836-0002	why should he not be as other men
1995-1836-0003	she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence and others
1995-1836-0004	as she awaited her guess she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and as quiet tude for her social functions were few to night there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james criton the rich english menufacturer and lady criton mister and missus vanderpol mister harry creswell an hiss sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey a selection of guess that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of coden interests earlier in the day
1995-1836-0005	missus gray had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vivid ly there cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made ap point of introducing fourth with
1995-1836-0006	she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister crestwell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
1995-1836-0007	do you believe in some education asked mary taylor
1995-1836-0008	i believe in the train in the people to ther haits capacity the englishmen here hartily seconded him
1995-1836-0009	but creswell added significantly copacity diffes in normous li between racees
1995-1836-0010	the bandor pools were sure of this and the englishman instancing india became quite eloquent missus gray was mistified but hardly dared admit et the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest crutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
1995-1836-0011	wals a timley her awic added criswell avoiding his sisters eyes
1995-1836-0012	but we're not a exactly welcome
1995-1836-0013	marry taylor however related the tail of sor to missus gray's private ear later
1995-1836-0014	for tunately said mister vanderfol nor ther nose and sawtinors all ribing at a belof mutual understanding on most of these matters
1995-1837-0000	he knew the silver fleese his ansor as must be ruined
1995-1837-0001	it was the first great sorrow of his life it was not so much the loss of the cottin itself but the fantasy the whopes the dreams built around it
1995-1837-0002	ah the swamp the cruel swamp
1995-1837-0003	the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly tol it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him ind burning wonder
1995-1837-0004	he panted to know if she too knew or new and cared not or cared and knew not
1995-1837-0005	she was so strange an human accreature
1995-1837-0006	the world was water beiled in mists
1995-1837-0007	then if was sudden admid day the sun shot out hod and still no breath of air stirred the sgy was like lue steel the earth steamed
1995-1837-0008	where was the use of imagining
1995-1837-0009	the lagood had been level with the dikes a week ago and now
1995-1837-0010	perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
1995-1837-0011	he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
1995-1837-0012	he plashed to stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the ramp art of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
1995-1837-0013	then he looked down the lagoon was dry
1995-1837-0014	he stood a moment bewoldered then turned and rushed upon the eisland a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept a place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green thic tall wet and willowy
1995-1837-0015	the squares of codd an sharp edge heavy were just about to burst to bulls
1995-1837-0016	but one long moment he paused stupid again with utter amazement then lane dizzly against the tree
1995-1837-0017	he gazed about put bleced astonished
1995-1837-0018	here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain someone had dug a an now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and cocked way thus allowing it to empty directly
1995-1837-0019	he sat down weak the wildered and one thought was up er most soara
1995-1837-0020	the years of the days of her dying were ten
1995-1837-0021	the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
1995-1837-0022	up in the sick roomes or lay on the little whide bed
1995-1837-0023	the ned and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strole for her life wosh narled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
1995-1837-0024	for while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure it son and bird and tree
1995-1837-0025	she roles with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulus slipped across the road and into the swamp
1995-1837-0026	she had been born within its borders within his border she had lived ind groan and within its border she had met her love
1995-1837-0027	ont she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton laborfore her
1995-1837-0028	the chair was empty but he knew
1995-1837-0029	he darted through the trees and pawsed a tall man strongly but slimly made
2094-142345-0000	it is a very fin old place of red brick softened by a pale powdery liken which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables the windows and the door place
2094-142345-0001	but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
2094-142345-0002	for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonrous bang behind the livery blackey who had just seen as master and misters off the grounds in a carriage and par
2094-142345-0003	a large opene fireplace with resty dogs in it and a barer boarded floor at the far end fleeces of wolves sbacked up in the middle of the floor some empty cornbags
2094-142345-0004	and what through the left hand window
2094-142345-0005	several clothes morses a pillion a spenning wale and an old box whyde open and stuffed full of coloured rags
2094-142345-0006	at the edge of this box their lives a great wooden dall which so far as mudilation is concern bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
2094-142345-0007	the history of the house is plain now
2094-142345-0008	but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the couched and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow billed ducks who are seasing the opportunity of gitting the grink with as much body in it as possible
2094-142345-0009	were the great barn doors are thrown wide open and men are busy there mending the harness under the superintendents of mister goby the woddaw otherwise satdler who entertains them with a latest tredleston gassap
2094-142345-0010	hathe surl often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned of looking at the pleacing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usrally turned up like a screen and was more for arnament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round peterdishes there were ranged on the shells above the long deal dinner table or in the hobs of the great which always shone like jasper
2094-142345-0011	do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish and her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than eight and thirty a fair complexion and sandy haire whell shapen light footed
2094-142345-0012	the family like this between her and her knees dina moris with e contrast between her keenness and dinas surrafhic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary
2094-142345-0013	her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a dame sol came with ag or shot seemed to take up an unfinished luxure as a barrel organ takes up a tune perecisely at the point where it had left off
2094-142345-0014	the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the wid ows and why i consequently missus poiser should scold molly the house made with unusual severity
2094-142345-0015	to all appearance molly had got through her after dinner work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to asks submissivly if she should sit down to her spinning till miltingtime
2094-142345-0016	spinning indeed

2094-142345-0030	toddy however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of wabbling run and an a mount of fat on the neieb of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
2094-142345-0031	and she was very found of you too an rechel
2094-142345-0032	i often heard her talk of you and the same sort of way

2094-142345-0043	by this time the twea gentleman had reached the palings ind had got down from their horses he was playin they meant to come in
2094-142345-0044	said mister irwin with his stately cordiality
2094-142345-0045	o ser dot mention it said miti's poycer
2094-142345-0046	i doliving your kitchen
2094-142345-0047	poiser is not at home is he
2094-142345-0048	said captain danny thorne sitting himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door
2094-142345-0049	no sir he isn't he's gone to roseter to see mister west the factor about the woll
2094-142345-0050	but there father in the barn sir if he'd be of any use
2094-142345-0051	no thank you i'll just look at the welbs and leave a message about them with your shepherd
2094-142345-0052	i must come annother day and see your husband i want to have a consultation with him about horses
2094-142345-0053	for if his anywhere in the farm we consend for him in a minute
2094-142345-0054	oh sir said missus poyser rather larmed you wouldn't like it at all
2094-142345-0055	but you know more about that than i do sir
2094-142345-0056	i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
2094-142345-0057	i knowce marm is in better order than any other with in ten miles of us than as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it
2094-142345-0058	by the by i've never seen your dary i must see your dairy missus poyser
2094-142345-0059	this misus poisor said blushing and believing that the captain was really interested in her melt pans and would ad just his opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy
2094-142345-0060	oh iave no doubt it's in capital order
2300-131720-0000	the paris planed like that of the chrystal palace was a temporary exhibit
2300-131720-0001	pulonden ply hat was last temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels curches doores and dwellings in the vicinity of holeburn vioduc
2300-131720-0002	there messier's johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
2300-131720-0003	the dynamo electric machine bot small was robust for under all the variing speeds of waterpower and the pecissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
2300-131720-0004	owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers an a son has been frequently spoken of as annaponent of the alternating courret
2300-131720-0005	why if we erect a station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
2300-131720-0006	there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
2300-131720-0007	broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is pidyo in cratically upposed to loosen wastful methods to plans e vempire that neglect the poor at the gate
2300-131720-0008	everything he has done has been amed at the concervation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
2300-131720-0009	for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against its seriously
2300-131720-0010	it could not be used for electoral plating or deposition nor could it charge to rige batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the directurrent
2300-131720-0011	but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts ar remote country resevens or a far mouse the alternating currents in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
2300-131720-0012	at isson was in tolerant of shamm on shaddi and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope tes tube and galvanometer
2300-131720-0013	unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governent regulated than those available for his dinamo and lamp at ason realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
2300-131720-0014	mister addison was a leader far ahead of the time
2300-131720-0015	he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction break also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator of verify it
2300-131720-0016	then again there was no nown way to lupricate an engin for continuous running and mister edison and form me  that as i marine engines started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times
2300-131720-0017	andison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multiple arch system covered by his feeter and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against ha straight to wire system throughout of the tree kind
2300-131720-0018	he soon foresaw that still greater aconomy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
2300-131720-0019	the strong position held by the edison's system under the strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and et gave an immediate empothus to incondicent lighting
2300-131720-0020	it was spetially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when te yield of six or eight lamps to the horse bower was considere subject for congratulation
2300-131720-0021	the street conductors were of the overhead poll lime construction adwar in stalled by the construction company that had been organized by adison to build an equips entral stations
2300-131720-0022	meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wir sistem known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent and vendors at practically the same time
2300-131720-0023	i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up
2300-131720-0024	but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
2300-131720-0025	they were later used as reserve bachines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edesonia but they remaine in practically as good condition as one installed in eighteen eighty three
2300-131720-0026	the arc labp and stalled outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public streetlighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lap might be out through accident
2300-131720-0027	evison held that the electricity sould must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
2300-131720-0028	there was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other invettors were also giving the subject bherthought the public took it for granted that any thing so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weded and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration
2300-131720-0029	hence the adison electoralitic meter is no longer used despite its axcellent qualities
2300-131720-0030	the principale employed in the adison electoralitic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to deacompose a chemical substance
2300-131720-0031	associated with thes simple form of apparatus were various in genious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit thaft of current or damage
2300-131720-0032	the standard adison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted
2300-131720-0033	in thecember eighteen eighty eight mister duw j jecks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
2300-131720-0034	the others having been an operation to short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
2300-131720-0035	in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of adison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the adnison mader was accurate and that it's use was not expensive for stations anbove one thousand lights and that the best financial results were in variably secured an a station selling current by meter
2300-131720-0036	the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
2300-131720-0037	he waiged at rewave the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
2300-131720-0038	he felld he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would sut himbetter
2300-131720-0039	the problem was solved
2300-131720-0040	we were more interested in the technical condition of the station that in the commercial part
2300-131720-0041	we had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid
237-126133-0000	here she would stay comfort ed and soothed the mon bhe lovely plants and richardxotics rejoicing the heart of old turn at the gardener who since poulysfirst raptrous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
237-126133-0001	every chance she could speall after practice hours were over and after the clamorest amands of the boys upon her time where fully satisfied was ceized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
237-126133-0002	then dear said missus witney you must be kind i to her than ever think what it would be f for one of you to be away from home even among friends
237-126133-0003	somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear at no longer
237-126133-0004	ti she could only see fhranzie for just one moment
237-126133-0005	ol she's always at the piano said fan she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
237-126133-0006	at this the bundle opend suddenly and out popped fronsye
237-126133-0007	but parly couldn't speak and abjasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have pumbled over backward from the stool fhransy and all
237-126133-0008	asked fhronsie with her little face closed upollhe's own
237-126133-0009	now you'll stay cried man say pouly moun't you

237-126133-0013	i know gasped polly andtrolling her sobs i won't only i can't thank you
237-126133-0014	asked franzie and intense interests slipping down out of poly's arms and crowding up close to jasper's side
237-126133-0015	yes all alone by himself asserted jasper beemently and winking periously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly proncy
237-126133-0016	ar no japter i ma go by my very own self
237-126133-0017	ber japp you've got it lapped percy while the other screamed at beside of jasper space
237-126133-0018	don't mind it polly whispered jasper wasnt her fault
237-126133-0019	dear me a jaculated the old gentleman and the utmost amazement and such a time as i have had to get her here too
237-126133-0020	how did her mother ever let her go
237-126133-0021	she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
237-126133-0022	id difn't have any fears if i worked to priely said the old gentleman complacently
237-126133-0023	he cried and highe dudgeen just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his mancy
237-126133-0024	and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
237-126133-0025	at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigerously
237-134493-0000	it is sixteen years said its john burk and died
237-134493-0001	his wife now lies beside him and the lhight shaft that marked their graves bleams across the wheat fields
237-134493-0002	from the nor wegon brave yard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheet and corn light and dark dark and light
237-134493-0003	from the grave yard gate one pen coun that dozen gayly painted farmhouses the deldid weather vains on the big red barns wenk at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
237-134493-0004	but air and the earth ore curiously maded and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
237-134493-0005	he was a splendid figure of a boy talm and straight as a young pine tree with ther handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
237-134493-0006	that's not much of a job for an athlete here i've been detown and back
237-134493-0007	ad exander that you sleepla
237-134493-0008	she gathered up her reins

237-134493-0013	indeed he had looked away with the purpose of noxseing it
237-134493-0014	they think your proud because you've been away to school or something
237-134493-0015	there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
237-134493-0016	on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange had his their glassy dreen mocking off the yellow fields
237-134493-0017	any one dhere about would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the devide and that the farmer was a woman alexandrabergson
237-134493-0018	there is even o white row of pehips an the orchard under the wal nut trees
237-134500-0000	frank red english spolly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
237-134500-0001	marie sighed
237-134500-0002	a breafh win had come up and was driving puppy white clouds across the sky
237-134500-0003	the arte resparkling and rippling in the sun
237-134500-0004	that invitation decided her
237-134500-0005	oh but i'm glad to get this place mod
237-134500-0006	just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after arrain
237-134500-0007	we never had so many of them in hare before
237-134500-0008	i suppose it's the wet season will you have to cut them too
237-134500-0009	i suppose that's the what thecent too then
237-134500-0010	it ecriting to the everything growing til faft and to get the grass cut
237-134500-0011	are you plashed look ut the spider webs all over the grass
237-134500-0012	in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pale and he began to swing his sih with that long even stroke thut fee american boys ever learned
237-134500-0013	myri picked jherrius and saying softly to herself stripping one glittering ranch after another shivering when she thought a show r op rain dropps on her neck and hair
237-134500-0014	and amial mone his way slowly down toward the cherry trees
237-134500-0015	that summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his men could do that heep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness
237-134500-0016	i don't know all of them but i know then an zar
237-134500-0017	if i feel that way i feel that way
237-134500-0018	he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet incipid fruit long ivery coloured barries tipped with maint pink like white carrel that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
237-134500-0019	he dropped a handful into her lap
237-134500-0020	yes don't you
237-134500-0021	oh ethers a much only he seems kind of stay it an school teachery
237-134500-0022	when the used the tell me about him ialways wondered whether she was n't pe little len love with him
237-134500-0023	it would serve you all right if she walked off with carl
237-134500-0024	i liked to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
237-134500-0025	oh amiel
237-134500-0026	surelhy you are not thinking of going off there
237-134500-0027	mariese bace fall under his brooding gaze
237-134500-0028	i am sure hi tats andra hopes you will stay on here she murmured
237-134500-0029	i don't want to spand around hem the dawn
237-134500-0030	i want to be nowing something on my own account
237-134500-0031	sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the foure corners of the devide together he threwhout his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a table cloth
237-134500-0032	i gat tired of seeing man and horses going up anddown up undown
237-134500-0033	i wish you weren't so rettless and didn't get so worked up over things she said sadly
237-134500-0034	thank you he returned a shortly
237-134500-0035	and you never used to be prosse to me
237-134500-0036	i can't play with you like a little boy an en more he  said slowly that's what you miss marie

237-134500-0038	an any haw there's nothing to understand
237-134500-0039	bhat mont last it will go away and things will be jrust as they used to
237-134500-0040	i pray for you but ghat's not the same as if you pray yourself
237-134500-0041	i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i won't pray not to have them not if i'm damned for it
237-134500-0042	but all our good times are over
260-123286-0000	saturday ougust fifteen the sea and broke in all round no land in sight
260-123286-0001	the horizon seemed extremely distant
260-123286-0002	ol my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well is nature has resumed its sway
260-123286-0003	you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious
260-123286-0004	one might be woth less reason than now
260-123286-0005	i hav not complaiting that the rat is slow but that the seat is so wide
260-123286-0006	we are losing time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little saile upon a pulon on a raft
260-123286-0007	he called the sea apo and i long uwaye taking a little sail
260-123286-0008	therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
260-123286-0009	i take this as my auntswer and i leave to professor to buite his lips with impatience

260-123286-0011	nothing knew whether unchanged the wind freshes
260-123286-0012	but there seemed no reason to fear
260-123286-0013	the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
260-123286-0014	truly the sea is of infinite wit
260-123286-0015	the must be is wide as the mediterranean wor they atlantic and why not
260-123286-0016	these thoughts additated me all day in my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleeve
260-123286-0017	i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
260-123286-0018	i saw at the hamberg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
260-123286-0019	i suppose professor leadon brock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pig his eyes ter ferse the ocean from side teside

260-123286-0021	during his watch i slept
260-123286-0022	two hours afterwards a terrible shock a wote me
260-123286-0023	tho wraft was headed up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
260-123286-0024	there's a whale awale cried the professor
260-123286-0025	fight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they willed around our little raft with a repidity greater than that of expressed trads
260-123286-0026	two monsters only recreating all this commotion and before my eyes are to rephiles of the primitive world
260-123286-0027	i can distinguish the eye of th ictheassourus glowing like a red hot co and his large as a man's head
260-123286-0028	it's jaw is e normous and according to naturalists is arned with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth
260-123286-0029	those huge creatures attack each other with a greatest animosity

260-123286-0031	as for the if the assourus as he returned whose submarine cabern
260-123288-0000	the rowings become last in the distance
260-123288-0001	the weather if we may use the term will change before lawn

260-123288-0007	the wind ever lolled but to acquire increased strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts in rushing storms
260-123288-0008	there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
260-123288-0009	those cloud seem as if they were going to crush the sea

2830-3979-0000	we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
2830-3979-0001	the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther and less we make an talk as you would talk to day to americans
2830-3979-0002	let us begin with that his commentary ongalations
2830-3979-0003	the undertaking which seemed so attractive when biewed as a literary task proved the most difficult one an at times became a precsive
2830-3979-0004	it was written in latin
2830-3979-0005	the work had to be condensed
2830-3979-0006	a word should now be said about the origin of luther's commentary ungulations
2830-3979-0007	much later when a friend of his was preparing an addition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine mygelations fornstance
2830-3979-0008	inother words these three men took dhown the lecures which lutheradressed to his students in the course of galations and roer prepared the manuscript for the printer
2830-3979-0009	the presents like no other of luther's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ merits alone
2830-3979-0010	but the essence of luther's lectures is there
2830-3979-0011	the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us power to serve and to do lop to
2830-3979-0012	the word of our god shall stand forever
2830-3980-0000	in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
2830-3980-0001	they said to the galations you have no right to think highly ofppaul
2830-3980-0002	he was the last aturned o crist
2830-3980-0003	polking later in his beneath us
2830-3980-0004	indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
2830-3980-0005	do you suppose they god for the sake of a few moothren heretics would thes emone his entire church
2830-3980-0006	against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defense his apostolic authority in ministry
2830-3980-0007	as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exult his office in order to gain a uthority among men
2830-3980-0008	paltics pridein his ministry not to his own praise but to the prise of god
2830-3980-0009	paul and a postle not of men et cetera
2830-3980-0010	either he calls ministers through the agency of men or ecalse them directly as he called the profits an apostles
2830-3980-0011	pald the clars of the false apostles were called hersent neither by men nor by man
2830-3980-0012	the most they could claim is that there were semply others
2830-3980-0013	he mentiones the apostles first because they were appointed direct the by god
2830-3980-0014	the call was not to be taken lightly
2830-3980-0015	for person the possess knowledge is not enough
2830-3980-0016	is spoils one's best work
2830-3980-0017	when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call
2830-3980-0018	i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
2830-3980-0019	i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught so fistrene set of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
2830-3980-0020	this is no sinful pride it is wholly pride
2830-3980-0021	in god the father who raised him from the dead
2830-3980-0022	the classemed superfulous on first sight
2830-3980-0023	these pervertors of the righesness of christ resist the father and the sun and the works of them both
2830-3980-0024	in this whole pestle paultreats of the resurrection of christ
2830-3980-0025	by his resurrection crist won the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell in every evil
2830-3980-0026	first two
2830-3980-0027	and all the breth room which are with me
2830-3980-0028	this should go far and shetting them mouse of the fals apostles
2830-3980-0029	although the brethrin with me ore not a possles like myself yet they are all af one mind with me think right and teach as i do
2830-3980-0030	they do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate they go vere the cuestions are
2830-3980-0031	why did they not invade the catholic provinces in preach their doctrine to god was princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god
2830-3980-0032	we look for that reward which i have not seen nor ear heard neither havh entered into the heart of man
2830-3980-0033	not all the galations had become prverted
2830-3980-0034	these means cannot be contaminated
2830-3980-0035	they remained divine regardless of men's opinion
2830-3980-0036	wherever the means of grac er found there is the holy church even though anti crise reins there
2830-3980-0037	so much for the title of the epistole now follows the greeding of the apostlee verse three
2830-3980-0038	grace be too you and peace from god the father and from our bord jhesus christ
2830-3980-0039	the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul an are now pretty well understood
2830-3980-0040	the greating of the apostles prefreshing
2830-3980-0041	grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
2830-3980-0042	the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
2830-3980-0043	experience proves this
2830-3980-0044	however the grace and piece of god will
2830-3980-0045	men should not speculate about the nature of god
2830-3980-0046	was it not enough to say from god the father
2830-3980-0047	to do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure into comprehend his infinite majesty
2830-3980-0048	he came down to earth lifed among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
2830-3980-0049	embrace him and forget about the nature of god
2830-3980-0050	did not crist himself say i am the way in the truth and the life no man come with unto the father but by me
2830-3980-0051	when you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
2830-3980-0052	we are to hear christ to has been appointed by the father as our divined teacher
2830-3980-0053	at the same time palkanfirms are creed that christ is very god
2830-3980-0054	that crist is very god is apparent in that paul scribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power do the spense grace and peace
2830-3980-0055	to bestow peacing grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot
2830-3980-0056	otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our bord jesus christ
2830-3980-0057	the arians took chice for a noble and perfect reacur superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
2830-3980-0058	mohammad also speaks highly of christ
2830-3980-0059	passtixs to his theme
2830-3980-0060	he never loses sight of the purpose of his opistle
2830-3980-0061	not gold or silver or passial lambs or n angel but himself what four
2830-3980-0062	not for a crown or a kingdom or ar goodness before sins
2830-3980-0063	underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
2830-3980-0064	how may we obtain temission of our sins
2830-3980-0065	pauliansers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sinse
2830-3980-0066	since christ was given for our sins at stands to reason that they calnot be put away by our own efforts
2830-3980-0067	this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make ammends for a single sin
2830-3980-0068	the greatness of the ransom christ some a god indicates this
2830-3980-0069	the vicious character of san his brought out by the words who gave himself for r sinse
2830-3980-0070	but we are careless we make light of sin
2830-3980-0071	we think that by some little work or merri we can dismiss in
2830-3980-0072	this passage then bears ut the fact that all men are sold an der sin
2830-3980-0073	this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that san is a small matter easily takin care of by good works that we must present ourselves onto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before may feel that christ was given for our sense
2830-3980-0074	the satitude is universal in particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
2830-3980-0075	but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
2830-3980-0076	on the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair
2961-960-0000	he passes a bruptly from persons tho ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers the persons from the heavens to men from a stronomy to physiology he confuses a rather does not distinguish subject in object first and final causes and is dreaming of juw metrical figures lost in a flios of sense
2961-960-0001	but influence which too to me is has exercised upon besterity is du partly to a misunderstanding
2961-960-0002	in the suppose teths of this dialogue the neo platinests found hidden meanings ind connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quiet at variante with the spirit of plato
2961-960-0003	they were absorbed in his theology and where under the do minion of his name while that which was truly great in truly correct ristic in him his effort to realize in connect ofstrections was not understood by them at all
2961-960-0004	there is no danger of the mardern commentators on the temeas falling into the ibbisurdities of the new yo platnests
2961-960-0005	in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
2961-960-0006	the fancies of the neo pladnists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a fase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own tay
2961-960-0007	but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spide they are apposed to him
2961-960-0008	we do not know how pla to would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the totrillogis which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
2961-960-0009	the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavily bodies and with man unly as one among the enimals
2961-960-0010	but he has not as yet the fined this antemediate territory which lies some were between medicine and methematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in rinking feries of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
2961-960-0011	with heratlitis he acknowledges the perpetual flooks like an excageros he is served the predominance of mine although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subdoing lite the pifigorians he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
2961-960-0012	many if not all the elements of the prie so cretic philosophy are included in the timeas
2961-960-0013	it is sprobable that the relation of the ideis to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
2961-960-0014	the ideas also remained but they have become types in nature forms of men animal spurts fishes
2961-960-0015	the style and plen of the tomeis tifferd greatly from bad of any other of the platanic dialogues
2961-960-0016	but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which hakes imits in the fedres or simposium
2961-960-0017	nothing can exceed the beauty or arbe of introduction in which his using words after his accustomed manner
2961-960-0018	but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is holdi given up
2961-960-0019	he could ride in one style but not in a nother tan the greek language had not as yet mean fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
2961-960-0020	in hence we find the same sort of quosin us in the temeos of plato which charact arizes the philosophical poem of the cricious
2961-960-0021	there is a ont of slow an often a defect of ribhen the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a grater use of epposition in more of repetition than occurs in playtols earlier ritings
2961-960-0022	playtol had not the command of his materials which would have eabled him to produce a perfect work of art
2961-961-0000	so rites begins to to me as with a summary of the republic
2961-961-0001	an now he desired to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
2961-961-0002	and therefore to you i turned to me as citizen of lowcres who are at once a philosopher in a statesman and to you cretious whom all of teniens know to be similarly accomplished into her morcreties whose also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
2961-961-0003	i will if to me as a proves i approve
2961-961-0004	listen ten so crites to a tale of solence who being the friend of drobidus my great grandfather told it to my grandfather tredious and he told me
2961-961-0005	some poems of solemn re recited by the boys
2961-961-0006	and what was the subject of the poer said the person who made the remark
2961-961-0007	the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
2961-961-0008	but the memory of their exploits had passed away owing to the webs of time and the extinction of the actors
2961-961-0009	tell us said the other the whole story in where solen heard the story
2961-961-0010	but in each hipt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us ragistered for ever in our temples
2961-961-0011	the genealogies which o have recited to earth out of your own annald solen ar amure children story
2961-961-0012	for in the times before the great flood atnings was the greatest and bast of cities and dead bhut noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven

2961-961-0017	observ again what cered do lot took in the persute of wisdom searching out the deep things of the worl and applying them to the use of men
2961-961-0018	the most fame os of them all was the overthrow of the island of a twentes

2961-961-0020	this is the excelamation of the shallows which are found in that part of the attlentic ocean
2961-961-0021	but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory
2961-961-0022	then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first to me is whis a natural philosopher whill speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of men and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost of fenan citizens are from the egyptian records spoke
3570-5694-0000	but aready at e point en economic evolution far and stating the emergence of the lady specialized consemption of a goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a moreol ess celebrite system
3570-5694-0001	the utality of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivotive growth
3570-5694-0002	such consumption as fals trough the women is mellion siddental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not to consemption directed to the own comfort and fullness of life
3570-5694-0003	with the farther advance and culchure this to be may change  into simple custom of a moreor less fregrous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be at a bu or a large conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
3570-5694-0004	in the nature of things lexuries and the comforts of life blong to the leisure class
3570-5694-0005	under the taboo saiden victels and more paticularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
3570-5694-0006	grenkiness and the other pathological consequences of the free ears of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become unerific as being a marke at the second remove of the superior stateus of those who are able to afford the indulgence
3570-5694-0007	it has even happened that the name for certain disease conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonum for noble or gentle
3570-5694-0008	the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
3570-5694-0009	with many quofifications with more quolifications as the patriarcal tradition has gradually weakened the general rute is fell to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
3570-5694-0010	the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household pereprenalia is an obvious exception to this roome but it will appear in the sequel dis ecception is much more obvious and substantial
3570-5694-0011	the custom of testiv gatherings probably ariginated in motives of commidiality and religion these moatives are also present in the late development tut they do not continue to be the soul motives
3570-5694-0012	there is a more al as alaborate system of ranking grates
3570-5694-0013	this de frentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequente inheritance of gentlity
3570-5694-0014	many of these affiliated gentlemen of lisure are the same time less a men of substance in the rown right so that some of them are scarcely at all aether sonly partilly to be rated as vi carious consumers
3570-5694-0015	se many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as i carious consumer without qualification
3570-5694-0016	many of these again and also many of the other are strucracy of listi grye having turn a toched to the persons ad more or less comprehensive group of i carious consumer in the persons of their wifes and children their servants retain ers et cetera
3570-5694-0017	the wearing of uniforms are liveries implies e considerable degree of dependence and maveen be said to be amark of servitude real are astensible
3570-5694-0018	the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be reftly divided into twoo classes the free and the servine were the noble and the ignoble
3570-5694-0019	but the general distinction is not a tatter count to be overlooked
3570-5694-0020	so those officers which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms an a cutrments and the like in short those switch may be classed as sustensibly predatory employments
3570-5694-0021	i never as in these cases the menial service ing question has to de directly with a primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected onarific character
3570-5694-0022	the livery becomes obnoxious tuneally oll who are required to wear it
3570-5695-0000	in a general way though not tollly nor consistently these two groups coincide
3570-5695-0001	the dependent who was first delegated for these stuties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in ta lated development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarly performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
3570-5695-0002	but as we descemd the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarous leasure in consumption devolve upon the wife alone
3570-5695-0003	in the communitys of the western culture this point is a present found among the low imiddle class
3570-5695-0004	if beautyor comfort is achieved and it is more al less portutous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves through th great economic law of wasted effort
3570-5695-0005	the man of the household also can do something in thes direcion and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtualy seize to consume valuable goods for apearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household pecuniaritecency
3570-5695-0006	very much of squallorand discomfort will be indured before the last trink et or the last pretence of pecunaritie sincees put away
3570-5695-0007	there is no class an no country that as yielded so obdectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
3570-5695-0008	the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the person's whose comvictions it is desired to affect
3570-5695-0009	each will there fore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
3570-5695-0010	the mudernerganization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
3570-5695-0011	it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the diraktion of hihtening the utility of conspicous consumption as compared with leisure
3570-5695-0012	it is also noticable that the surv sibility of consumption is a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community wheth human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
3570-5695-0013	consemption becomes a larger element in the sander of living in the city than in the country
3570-5695-0014	among the country population its places to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighbored gossips sufficiently to serve the light general purpose of pecuniary repuit
3570-5695-0015	the result is a great mability of the labor imploint in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well define and consetrable buddy of workmen
3570-5696-0000	under the simple test of affectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consemption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary amulation pretty evenly between the atthe outset
3570-5696-0001	but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came toold e rank faramet above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and das an element in the standard of decency during the course i peaceful culture
3570-5696-0002	are the circumstance permitting that instinct dispose s men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use
3570-5696-0003	i reconciliation between the two conflict ting requirements is affected by resort to make believs men and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations ave founded with some specious object of amiliration and bodied in their official styl entitle ther is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the tack is may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effect cial economic value of their traffic
3570-5696-0004	the sailent features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
3570-5696-0005	throughout the entire evolution of conspicious expenditure whether of good sar of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to affectually mend the consumer's good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities
3570-5696-0006	as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of depprecation
3570-5696-0007	the use of the wood waste as a technical term therefore impries no deprecation of the motives or of the end' sart by the constumer under this canon of conspicuous waste
3570-5696-0008	but it is another grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of every day life implies therprication of what is characterized a suastepull
3570-5696-0009	in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicious waste but such expenditure as his encured in the grond of an invitious pecuniary comparison
3570-5696-0010	and artica may be useful in wastful both and it's setelited to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions

3575-170457-0001	whyare we to be denied each other society
3575-170457-0002	why are we to be divided
3575-170457-0003	surely i must be because we're in danger of loving each other too well of losing sight of the creator and idolotry of the creature

3729-6852-0006	sylvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because herself love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
3729-6852-0007	two years before her death i saw her berform thet character of marry anne in the comedy of meravox and in spite of her age and declining health the allusion was complete

5105-28240-0001	it was quite true that a vessel was insight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the top mass alone was visible above the water
5105-28240-0002	exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope
5105-28240-0003	she is undersaile but she is count timishef's yacht he was right
5105-28240-0004	if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival
5105-28240-0005	he reckoned therefore not only upon anscertaining the extent of the late atastrophe but upon learning its cause
5105-28240-0006	the wind being adverse the dobrena did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold the steady course
5105-28240-0007	servadack took it for granted that the dogrina was endeavoring to put in
5105-28240-0008	a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the rougfest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters
5105-28240-0009	slightly changing her course she first struck her main sail and in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her two top sails rigantine an jib
5105-28240-0010	captain servadack hastened toward him
5105-28240-0011	i left you on a contimnent and here i have the honour of finding you on an island

5105-28240-0013	nothing more than you know yourself
5105-28240-0014	are you certain that this is the mediterranean
5105-28240-0015	for some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied and then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions
5105-28240-0016	to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
5105-28240-0017	some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements
5105-28240-0018	you will take me on board count will you not
5105-28240-0019	my yard is at your service sir even should you require to make a tour round the world
5105-28240-0020	the count shook his head
5105-28240-0021	before starting it was indispensible but the engine of the dugrena should be repaired to saile under canvus only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult
5105-28240-0022	it was on the last ey of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed
5105-28240-0023	a slight dimmunution i may eccessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alterration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide
5105-28240-0024	doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for bensoof to accompany his master
5105-28241-0000	her sea going qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe
5105-28241-0001	after an opprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant an mecount appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by farther greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
5105-28241-0002	the late estounding events however had rendered procope manifastly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety
5105-28241-0003	steam up and canvas spread the scooner started eastwards
5105-28241-0004	although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the demmunution t in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particle so boyant that by the mere effect of oscilation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
5105-28241-0005	for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by be coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
5105-28241-0006	the law hen thec compass therefore where able to be called upon to do the work of the sextent which had become utterly useless
5105-28241-0007	there's no far of that sir
5105-28241-0008	at the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not encurring any probable risk of being perecipitated onto the sun
5105-28241-0009	and what demonstration do you offer asked serve a ack eagerly that it will not happen
5105-28241-0010	ocean reigned supreme
5105-28241-0011	all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts spead away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the adgerian watropolis
5105-28241-0012	his it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely
5105-28241-0013	would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible
5105-28241-0014	another circumstance was most remarkable
5105-28241-0015	to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth o from for ti five fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in the emmy degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terrassed like the seats of an empatheatre
5105-28241-0016	you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined
5105-28241-0017	after pondering a while he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fabhoms five fathoms
5105-28241-0018	its depth remained in variable still four or at most five fathoms and although it's bottom was a siduously dredged it was only to prove it bearon of marine production of any type
5105-28241-0019	nothing was to be done but to put about and return and disappointment toward the north
5142-33396-0000	at another time harald asked

61-70970-0020	will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
61-70970-0021	they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a save crossing of the stable roofs
61-70970-0022	robin entered the hot dragging the unwilling esquire after him
61-70970-0023	be not so foolish friend said fittuoth crossly
61-70970-0024	they moved there after cautiously about the hut groping before and about them to find something to show that the warrant in idfulfilled as mission
61-70970-0025	there were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuttly ha tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit
61-70970-0026	fittuths hand rested at last upon the top rumn of a ladter and slowly the truth came to him
61-70970-0027	robin carefully descended the latter ind found himself soon upon firm brocky ground
61-70970-0028	studtly was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to as certain the shape and character of this fault
61-70970-0029	from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrantons
61-70970-0030	save me master's but you startled me rarely
61-70970-0031	cried he waving the lanthern before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him
61-70970-0032	inquired robin with his suspicion still upon him
61-70970-0033	truly such a horse would be worth much and notting him fair
61-70970-0034	day nad lording antered morrinton with a half laugh
61-70970-0035	warrant an spoke thus with significance to show rob in that he was not to think jeffrey's claimed to the estate would be passed by
61-70970-0036	robind fitsoth saw that his doubts of warrn in had been onfair and he became machamed to himself for harporing them
61-70970-0037	his tones rang pleasantly onwarrantans ears and fourth with the good fellowship was haralded between them
61-70970-0038	the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gaimwill at this passage way led from the hut in the pleasants to shurwood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
61-70970-0039	he implores us to be disgreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life as in the hollow of our hands
61-70970-0040	they regain their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gainwell
672-122797-0000	out in the woods stood a nice little fur tree
672-122797-0001	the plac he had was a very good one the sun shown on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs
672-122797-0002	he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
672-122797-0003	but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
672-122797-0004	in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right over the little tree
672-122797-0005	oh that made him so angry
672-122797-0006	to grow and grow to get oldr and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most lightful thing in the world
672-122797-0007	in autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
672-122797-0008	this happened every year and the young furtry that had now grown to a very comply sized trembled the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and beare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were ladin carts and the horses dragged othem out of the wood
672-122797-0009	have you not met the many were
672-122797-0010	rejoice in ty growth said the sunbeams
672-122797-0011	and then what happens then
672-122797-0012	i would fay no if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
672-122797-0013	i am now tall in my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
672-122797-0014	were i but old ready on the cart
672-122797-0015	were i in the warm room with all the splendor an magnificence
672-122797-0016	yes and something better something still grandler will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ortament me
672-122797-0017	something better something still grander must follow but what
672-122797-0018	brechoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight
672-122797-0019	rejoice in my own fresh youth
672-122797-0020	but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter in summer
672-122797-0021	and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
672-122797-0022	the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pang as like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
672-122797-0023	he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
672-122797-0024	but departure was not at all agreeable
672-122797-0025	the trie olly came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others
672-122797-0026	there too were large easy chairs silken sophas large tables full of picture books and full of toys with hundreds and hundreds of crowns and thest the childrens had so
672-122797-0027	the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
672-122797-0028	this evening they all said
672-122797-0029	how it will shine this stevening
672-122797-0030	perhaps the other trees from the forest were come to booket me
672-122797-0031	it blazed up famously help help
672-122797-0032	cri the young ladies a d they quickly put out the fire
672-122797-0033	a story
672-122797-0034	a story cried the children drawing t e little fat man towards the tree
672-122797-0035	but i shall tell only one story
672-122797-0036	am be don't be fill downstairs and yet he married the princess
672-122797-0037	that's the way of the world
672-122797-0038	thought the fir trye and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
672-122797-0039	i won't tremble to morrow thought the fur tree
672-122797-0040	and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
672-122797-0041	in the morning the servants and the housemaide came in
672-122797-0042	but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here it had dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
672-122797-0043	what's the mean thing of this tght the tree
672-122797-0044	and he leaned against the wall lost in revery
672-122797-0045	time enough had he two for his reflections for days and night's passed on and nobody came up and when it lasts tomebody did camt it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way
672-122797-0046	t is now winter out of doors fhought the tree
672-122797-0047	how kind man is after all
672-122797-0048	if donly were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
672-122797-0049	sweak squick
672-122797-0050	they snuffed about the vertree and rustled among the branches
672-122797-0051	i am by no means old said the fer tree
672-122797-0052	there's many a one considerably older than i am
672-122797-0053	they were so extremely curious
672-122797-0054	i know no such place said the tree
672-122797-0055	and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
672-122797-0056	said the fur tree thinking over what he had himself related
672-122797-0057	yes henriality those were happy times
672-122797-0058	po he is hopy dumpy asked the mice
672-122797-0059	only that one answered the tree
672-122797-0060	it is a very stupid story
672-122797-0061	don't you know one about bican and talo candles can't you tell any lader stories
672-122797-0062	no said the tree
672-122797-0063	then good by said the rats and they went homea
672-122797-0064	at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mie sat round me and listened to what i told them
672-122797-0065	now that two is over
672-122797-0066	why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft
672-122797-0067	the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
672-122797-0068	but it was not the tir tree that they meant
672-122797-0069	it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
672-122797-0070	the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
672-122797-0071	in the court yard some of the marriad children were playing who had danced a christmas round the tur tree and were so glad at the sight of him
672-122797-0072	and the gardeners boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
672-122797-0073	the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and its side so teeply
672-122797-0074	however fhact was over  now the tree gone the story had an end
6829-68769-0000	to it ten beth refram from delling tha other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watton in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for fourten ocheck
6829-68769-0001	it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates baged fair to serve a lengthy term in the state's prison as a consequence of his rash act
6829-68769-0002	i gan't see it in that light said the old lowyer
6829-68769-0003	it was a deliberate teft from his employer's to protect a girl he loved
6829-68769-0004	but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of a resting her were probably a mere bluff
6829-68769-0005	he was sou harded in impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stout to count the cost
6829-68769-0006	if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forge check then the young man would be allowed as freedom
6829-68769-0007	but under the circumstances idoubt of such an arangement could be made
6829-68769-0008	fairview was twelve miles away but by ten o'clock tey drew up at the county drail
6829-68769-0009	they were eceived in the little office by a man named markhum who was the jailer
6829-68769-0010	we wished to talk with him answered kenneth talk

6829-68769-0015	sometimes um that yearn infer a smoke am nearly crazy annot don't know which is worse diing one way or theo ther
6829-68769-0016	he arnocked the door in called here's visitors tom
6829-68769-0017	worse tom worse en error replied the chailer glomily
6829-68769-0018	mister graff said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the white from the passage fell upon it
6829-68769-0019	sartly havent any oreception room in the jail
6829-68769-0020	se town please said gates an a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a penchere
6829-68769-0021	a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
6829-68769-0022	we have heard something of your story said kenneth and our interested in it
6829-68769-0023	i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did it
6829-68769-0024	hold well as a fine fellow te poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident
6829-68769-0025	then roders woultn't do anything but leader around and waited upon her and the place went to rocken ruin
6829-68769-0026	he spoke simply but pasted up and down te narrow sell in fromt of them
6829-68769-0027	whose name did she signed to the check asked kenneth
6829-68769-0028	he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concert
6829-68769-0029	it's a stock company in rich
6829-68769-0030	i was bit keeper so it was easy to get a blink check and forged the signature
6829-68769-0031	as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved him a heavy loss one day
6829-68769-0032	i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plent but marshall never even thinke me
6829-68769-0033	it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling tent to now the truth
6829-68769-0034	i'm going to see mister marshall said kendeth and discover what i can do to as his you thank you sir
6829-68769-0035	i won't be much but im grateful to find a friend
6829-68769-0036	they left him then for the jailor arive to a lock the door and a scort them to the office
6829-68769-0037	i've seen lots of that kind of my day
6829-68769-0038	and it runes a ands jisposition
6829-68769-0039	he looked up rather ungraciousleep but motion them to be seated
6829-68769-0040	some girl has been in here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admitter
6829-68769-0041	i'm not electioneering just now
6829-68769-0042	oh well sir what about him
6829-68769-0043	and he desserves a term and states prison
6829-68769-0044	it is cos me twice sixty dollars in annoyance
6829-68769-0045	i'll pay all the conpesides
6829-68769-0046	your foolish why should you do all this
6829-68769-0047	i have my own reasons mister marshall
6829-68769-0048	give me a check for a hundred and fifty and i'l turnd over to you the forge check and qash further proceedings
6829-68769-0049	ha dedtested the grasping despisiouson that would endeavour to take advantage of his evident desire to help youn gates
6829-68769-0050	bet's uneasy at a silence nudged him
6829-68769-0051	there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrood face
6829-68769-0052	he might have had that forge ceck for the face of it if he'd been sharp
6829-68769-0053	and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
6829-68771-0000	so to the surprise at the democratic committee and alwas friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forcs aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
6829-68771-0001	one of fister hopkins first pasks after calling his faithful hinchmen around him was to make a careful canvase of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
6829-68771-0002	the weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from  opposition
6829-68771-0003	the democratic committee figured out away to do this
6829-68771-0004	under ordinary conditions renolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to ele copkins
6829-68771-0005	the only thingnecessary was to fix seth renalds and this howkins arranged personally
6829-68771-0006	and this was whie kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
6829-68771-0007	tha description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both waughing hartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupant of the other vehicle were

6930-76324-0028	well id confisced at the bord et up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probdly not much later
6930-81414-0000	no words were spoken no language was uttered saved on of waling in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and nodd en reality
6930-81414-0001	i heard a noise behind i turned and saw caffer his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but a had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
6930-81414-0002	onward said a distant voice
6930-81414-0003	no sound broke the stillness of the knight
6930-81414-0004	the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said
6930-81414-0005	what was that
6930-81414-0006	what then a human hand large and shapely appear distinctly on the surface of the pond
6930-81414-0007	nothing more not even the rist to which it might be attached
6930-81414-0008	it did not beckin or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
6930-81414-0009	i a woke to consciousness fighting at first is seemed as if i was fighting with the fantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was catfere
6930-81414-0010	a sound of voices ae flash of light
6930-81414-0011	a feeling of freedom and i was awake where
6930-81414-0012	said another voice which i recognized i falt tars casher
6930-81414-0013	i had scarcely known what i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand
6930-81414-0014	in the light of the moon i saw a knife rad with blood and my hand too was also discolored
6930-81414-0015	i do not know i am dazed bewildered
6930-81414-0016	but that is caffer's knife
6930-81414-0017	i know he had at dhis vary evening
6930-81414-0018	i remember saying have we been begether
6930-81414-0019	bor chair picked up something from the ground and looked at it
6930-81414-0020	i say you do know what this means and you must tell us
6930-81414-0021	a terrible thought flashed into my mind
6930-81414-0022	i had again beetn acting under the influence of this man's power
6930-81414-0023	perchance too caffer's death might serve him in good stead
6930-81414-0024	my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech laughed me
6930-81414-0025	my position was too terrible
6930-81414-0026	my over brought nerves yielded ot last
6930-81414-0027	for some time after that i remembered nothing tistinctly
7021-79730-0000	the three modes of management
7021-79730-0001	to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
7021-79730-0002	my reason and affection
7021-79730-0003	as the chase drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor destrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill humour sirge and swell among those delegate organizations un which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and a reparable injury
7021-79730-0004	the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that marry can no longer watch the expression of her continance ghoes away from the door with a smile of complasency and senisfaction ut her face at the engenuity and uccess of her little partifice
7021-79730-0005	so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
7021-79730-0006	the mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appealed to her affection
7021-79730-0007	if you should not be a good girl what should sho signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
7021-79730-0008	but this last upposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been avitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
7021-79730-0009	it is indeed true that the importance of tac and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated
7021-79740-0000	to such persons these interact modes of training children inhabits of subordination two their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
7021-79740-0001	della had a young sister named maria and a cousin whose name was jane
7021-79740-0002	now gellia cantrive to obtain a great influence and a cendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
7021-79740-0003	to givan idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
7021-79740-0004	you have come and della and dela was the name of jeane's dall to make rosely of visit
7021-79740-0005	i am very glad
7021-79740-0006	i expect you have been a very good girl and ella since you were here last
7021-79740-0007	then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl jane
7021-79740-0008	for instance one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other play things and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
7021-79740-0009	they were now playing with their dolls in the parlour
7021-79740-0010	deli  came to the parlour and with an air of great mystery teckened the children aside and set to them in a wisper leave and della and rosely here and don't say a word to them
7021-79740-0011	so saying she led the way on tipto followed by the children out of the room and round by a sircutous root to the piazza there
7021-79740-0012	said she pointing to the blay things see
7021-79740-0013	put these plea things all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know anything about your leaving them out
7021-79740-0014	and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in maying them dispose to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
7021-79759-0000	nature of the effect produced by early impressions
7021-79759-0001	that is comparatively nothing
7021-79759-0002	theyre chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
7021-79759-0003	vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
7021-79759-0004	without going to any such extremist this we can easily see unreflection how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action im mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impresse upon the mind
7021-79759-0005	the pain produced by an apt of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
7021-85628-0000	but ander's cared nothing about that
7021-85628-0001	he made abou so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumb founded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders
7021-85628-0002	he was such a big boy that he were hyh boots and carried a jack nife
7021-85628-0003	now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and ander's new that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jacknife
7021-85628-0004	yes why not thought anders
7021-85628-0005	seeing that i am so fine i may as well go and visit the king
7021-85628-0006	i am boing to the court ball answered anders
7021-85628-0007	and she took andhers hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and threw the matnificent halls where courtiers in silk and vilvet stood bowing whereever he went
7021-85628-0008	four like is not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap
7021-85628-0009	at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rose
7021-85628-0010	on huge silverplatters wore pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering to cantors
7021-85628-0011	the princess sat down under a blue canopy with boquazse a roses and she let ander sit in a golden chair by her side
7021-85628-0012	but you must tat eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to taye it off
7021-85628-0013	the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which is mother had made he would not give up on any condition
7021-85628-0014	he only shook his head
7021-85628-0015	well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chaine around his neck and thent down and kissed him
7021-85628-0016	that is a very fine cap you have he said
7021-85628-0017	so it is sen anders
7021-85628-0018	and it is made of mothers best yarn and she mittet at herself and everybody onte to get it away from me
7021-85628-0019	with one jump anders get out of his chair
7021-85628-0020	he darted like en arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yard
7021-85628-0021	he still held un to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
7021-85628-0022	and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
7021-85628-0023	but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown he said that anders was a stupid
7021-85628-0024	anders face grew red
7021-85628-0025	but his mother hugged him close
7021-85628-0026	no my little sun she said
7021-85628-0027	if you dressed im silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
7127-75946-0000	at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at fie o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated custume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornoment workers of the court
7127-75946-0001	ah very well
7127-75946-0002	lat am come in then said the king and is if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself aloront with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two cuartiees

7127-75946-0006	he has given them with too much grac nut to have others still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment
7127-75946-0007	it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
7127-75946-0008	does your imajesty then no longer believe that disloyal attempt
7127-75946-0009	not at all you are on the contrary most degreeable to me
7127-75946-0010	your majesty is planned then in this affair is
7127-75946-0011	you will take them from my private treasure
7127-75946-0012	the news circulated with the repidity of lightning during its progress it cendled every variety of cocatry desire and whild ambition
7127-75946-0013	the king had completed his toilet by nine o'clock he appeared an an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
7127-75946-0014	the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent daas or platform arected upon the borders of the lake it a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction
7127-75946-0015	suddenly for the purpose of restoring peace in order spraing accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
7127-75946-0016	the seasons halles of spring followed him closely to form a quadreal which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the nands
7127-75946-0017	his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage ind flesh colored silk and hose of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
7127-75946-0018	there was something in his carriage which resembled the boyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to sore along
7127-75946-0019	yes it is suppressed
7127-75946-0020	far from its sire your majesty haveen given no directions about it they musicians have retained im
7127-75946-0021	yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet
7127-75946-0022	sire he said your majesties most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with somilar zeal that he is already shown on the field of battle
7127-75946-0023	the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
7127-75946-0024	monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
7127-75946-0025	the balley began the effect was more than beautiful
7127-75946-0026	when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutered pandemime of the period only the more natural on account of the varyan different acting of the august actors had reached its commonating point of triumph the theatere shook with tummultuous a plause
7127-75946-0027	disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgement he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess
7127-75946-0028	by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied
7127-75946-0029	th the king who had from thi moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadreal cast a luok upon his vanquished rival
7127-75947-0000	every one could observe his agitation and prostration opprestration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and as eyes witholl their bright intelligence be demed
7127-75947-0001	upon this madame daine t turn her eyes languishingly towards the comt observing

7127-75947-0006	the princess inquired no

8224-274384-0006	the king stood up and called for that sum which begins with these words
8224-274384-0007	have marcy lord on me i pray for men would me devour
8224-274384-0008	the good natured audience im piti to fall in majesty showed for one greater defference to the king than to the minister and sung the salm which the former had called for
8224-274384-0009	the parliament and discots laid their proposals before the king
8224-274384-0010	before the settlement hof turns the administration must be possessed intirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms and how incompatible that scheme wiuth the liberty of the king is easily imagined
8224-274384-0011	the english it is evident had they not been previously assured of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable assum and wuile they weakened themselves by the same measure have strengthened e people with whom they must afterwards have so material than interest to discuss
8224-274384-0012	if any still retained rancer against him in his present condition they passed in silence while his well wishes more generous than prudent accompanied his march with tears with hatclamations and with prayers for his safety
8224-274384-0013	his death in this conjuncture was a public misfortune
8230-279154-0000	the analysis of knowledge wil occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
8230-279154-0001	what is called perception differs from sinsation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual coreletes all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
8230-279154-0002	whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions every one would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that i das a proximately represent impressions
8230-279154-0003	and what sort of evidence is logically possible
8230-279154-0004	there is no logical impossibility ind the hygh pothesis that the world spring into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past
8230-279154-0005	all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
8230-279154-0006	the behaviourest who attempts to make psychology arecord of behavior has to trust his memory and making the record
8230-279154-0007	habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviorist fhills confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
8230-279154-0008	but i do not think such an ifference is warranted
8230-279154-0009	our confidence or lack of competence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself sence we cannot avoke the past botily and compare it with the present image
8230-279154-0010	we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but horibly distorted
8230-279154-0011	some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others pill strange
8230-279154-0012	familiarity is a filling capable of degrees
8230-279154-0013	in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
8230-279154-0014	i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to the count for our knowledge of the past
8230-279154-0015	they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
8230-279154-0016	an actual fact there are doubtless various factors that can cur and giving us the filling of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event
8230-279154-0017	there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
8230-279154-0018	there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
8230-279154-0019	it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of fiellings giving their temperal relation to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play in a sential part in the process of dating remembered ifnce
8230-279154-0020	if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
8230-279154-0021	remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or lated to what is remembered
8230-279154-0022	tsome points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
8230-279154-0023	and this case as in most others what may be taken a certain in advance is rather vague
8230-279154-0024	the first of our vague but intubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
8230-279154-0025	we might provisionally theugh perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue and our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
8230-279154-0026	this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
8230-279154-0027	a grammaphone by the help of seuitable records mit relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramiphones as they like to believe
8230-279154-0028	i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be holly habit that enables me to do this
8230-279154-0029	the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
8230-279154-0030	semmons to books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
8230-279154-0031	they give waws according to which images of pass occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images referr to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
8230-279154-0032	it is this that is a venturost to theory of knowledge
8230-279154-0033	it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
8230-279154-0034	whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object at leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
8230-279154-0035	thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling o familiarity alone
8230-279154-0036	a further stage is recognition
8230-279154-0037	direcognition and this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of a sociation the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
8230-279154-0038	we are of course an fact able to judge when we recognize the object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless hade the experience of recognition ind this first sence of the word
8230-279154-0039	this knowledge is memory in once sense though an another it is not
8230-279154-0040	there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
8230-279154-0041	the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is conducted with what i am experiencing now by certainlangks of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
8230-279154-0042	thus if i recognize e thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single oubt from the rest of the world
8230-279154-0043	of course the words this has existed before are a fary inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable wherds are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means permitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as it recognition
8455-210777-0000	i remaind there a lone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
8455-210777-0001	had ever cress weller not been good looking had jack ban still a college had sir kennyton obal remained in angland had mister bunnet and the barkeeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in a rating for the final departure of my old friend
8455-210777-0002	on arriving at home and my own residence i found that our calon was filled with a brilliant company
8455-210777-0003	as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mote of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
8455-210777-0004	i have come to your sures mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this disin quarter of the world
8455-210777-0005	we have our little shruggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rosewater
8455-210777-0006	we are quite satisfied now captain battle ax said my wife
8455-210777-0007	quite satisfied said eva
8455-210777-0008	the ladies and compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic or on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other
8455-210777-0009	no doubt im process of time the ladies will follow
8455-210777-0010	there masters said missus never bend
8455-210777-0011	i did not mean said captan battllax tho touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
8455-210777-0012	missus never been you mustn'tdeed be proud of your son
8455-210777-0013	jack hadben standing in the four corner the room talking to eva and was now reduced tho silence by his praises
8455-210777-0014	sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife
8455-210777-0015	ai amd my wife and son and the two cress wellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next
8455-210777-0016	this i felt was paid to me as being president o the republic and i endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but i could not ufeel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordiinary life
8455-210777-0017	my wife on the spuro the moment managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner
8455-210777-0018	this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with there
8455-210777-0019	then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who ere for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
8455-210777-0020	oh yes said jack and i'm nowhere
8455-210777-0021	but i mean to have my innings before long
8455-210777-0022	of what missus never been had gone through and providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplishe her task with thorough success
8455-210777-0023	we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then when ashore
8455-210777-0024	how much of evil af real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me druing the last few days
8455-210777-0025	what can i do now but just lay n myself down and die
8455-210777-0026	and the death of which i dreamp could not alas
8455-210777-0027	when this captain should have taken himself and as vessel back to england i would retire to a small form which i possessed at the further's side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days
8455-210777-0028	jack would become evas happy husband and would remain amist the hurried duties of the eager world
8455-210777-0029	thinking of all this i went to sleep
8455-210777-0030	mister never bend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president the cannot be thenined that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
8455-210777-0031	you have received us with all that courtesy in hospitality for which your character and an england stand so high
8455-210777-0032	it is a duty said i
8455-210777-0033	but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yielding to it
8455-210777-0034	not a doubt but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you
8455-210777-0035	that is all quite true mister never been said sir ferdmand obran
8455-210777-0036	i can afford to smile because i am absolutely parilous before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
8455-210777-0037	you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
8455-210777-0038	therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a kourtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
8455-210777-0039	i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on bor
8455-210777-0040	then said sirferd nando there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him
8455-210777-0041	there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
8455-210777-0042	you hear what sir fer mand o brown has said replied captain battle ax
8455-210777-0043	but what is the delicate mission asked
8455-210777-0044	i was to be taken away in carriageto england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage and mattered not wich
8455-210777-0045	then the republic of briton yula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor and stalled an e executive chambers
8455-210777-0046	you may be quite sure ts there said captain battle ax and that i can so use it as to half a blitterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
8455-210777-0047	you proposed to kidnap me i said
8455-210777-0048	what woul become with your gun where i to kidnapp you
8455-210777-0049	lieutenant crosse trees is a very gallant officer
8455-210777-0050	one of us always remains onpoard while the other is on sure
8455-210777-0051	what worldwide inniquity such a speech as that thescloseves sad i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had ap been possible my dislike sentured itself unsirferd mando
8455-210777-0052	you will allow me to suggest sait he but that is a matter of opinion
8455-210777-0053	were i took comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
8455-210777-0054	the letter ran as follows
8455-210777-0055	sir i haven't incommand to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britain yula
8455-210777-0056	the procurlar circumstances of the colony are within your excellence's knowledge
8455-210777-0057	but in their selection of a constitution the britaon uless have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprong their present difficulties
8455-210777-0058	it is found in on the acknowledge weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work
8455-210777-0059	but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor
8455-210777-0060	the john brik is arm with a weapon of greek power against which it is impossible that the people of britain yulo should prevail
8455-210777-0061	you will carry out with you one hundred men of the north northwest burmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that of mister never been be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
8455-210777-0062	when do you intend that the john bright shall start
8455-210777-0063	today i shauted
8455-210777-0064	and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archies of the government
8455-210777-0065	i shall be happy to take charge of them said sirfern ando
8455-210777-0066	they of course must all be auter
8455-210777-0067	or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
8455-210777-0068	your paret is sufficient i said
8455-210777-0069	if you will give us your promise to meet captim adlax here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
8455-210777-0070	and this plan was adopted too in order to ebxtract from me a promise that i would depart ind peace
8463-287645-0000	this was what dared the misthiv so far as the running away was concerned
8463-287645-0001	it is hardly necessary to say more of them here

908-31957-0009	and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god has willed a still renewable fear
908-31957-0010	oh love oh troth
908-31957-0011	and love be false
908-31957-0012	if he to keep one oath must lose one joy but his life's star for tole
