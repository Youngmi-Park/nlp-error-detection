the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or t least only in such mister faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact your producing jewelers work rather than pictures
thet astyle as restrained or severe does not mean that it is also a runius
in all earrly gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and regidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid ropose of classic art

let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
poar dogbess before his death when it was in sighe committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushe to little circle of the night of the forth
the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a range of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had in a manner fe gun
he had for his own town residence of big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home and old family place in essex that he wished for immediately to proceed
the arkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took aball as time
they were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
i don't anticipate
she was young i'm tried nervous it was a vision of serious duties ind little company for really great loneliness

but it was that all her reward whone of the ladies asked
how strange at seemed to the sad woman as she watched the groth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that throwh its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of morals and to be finely a blessed soul in heaven
yet these thoughts affected hester prin less with hope than apprehension
the child had a native grace which does not embariably coexist with faultless beauty it's a tire however simple always impresse the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
this outward newt ability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life
hester putd only account for the child's character and even then most vagally end imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
there were now alluminated by the morning radionce of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whor awind
hester prin nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of eiring on the side of undue soverity
mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant and mortality that was committed to her charge
as to any other kind of discipline whether address to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordnace with the kaprice that rolled the moment
it was a look so intelligent yet anexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanyed by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not hele questioning a such moments whether pearl was a human child
beholding it haster was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elph in the flight which she envariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
brooding over all these matters the mother felt like wone who has a voke to spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence

hester print went one day to the mansion of governor belling ham with a pair of bloves which she had frnged and emboidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused the sformer ruler to descend a step for two from the highest rank he still held and honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves inpelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the suttlement
at that epic of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and a fhar less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state
the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only cause a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature

it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter in dowled with life
the mother herself as if the red ignomine were so deeply scorched andto her brain that all her conceptions a soned its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid in genuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture
but in truth for al was the one as well as the other and only inconsequence of that identity had haster contrive so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance
come therefore and let us sling mud at them
but perl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the not of her enemies and put them all to flight
she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them
it was further decorated with strange and seemingly capolistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when nowly laid on and had now grown hard and doorable for the admiration of after times
they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projecton of the adofice in both of which were latis windows the wooden shutters to close over them at need

fearl accordingly ran to the bowindow at the further end of the hall and looked along the viste of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and invetor attempt at shrubery
but the proprietor appeared already to have reelinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening
there were a few rose bushes however an a number of apple trees probably the descendents of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the penincula that half mithological personage who rides through our early annals seaded on the back of a ball

he were blue silk stockings blue nee pans with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braded with gold
his hat had a peaked crown in a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells tha tinkled when he moved
instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turnover tops and as blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid
for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful and of os in which they lived
when they were outside ung simply laphed the door and started up the path
no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the monchkins from the country of the gillickans the path divided
he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was there nearest neighbour
all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and adnoon unk and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
then they started on again and two hours later came an sight of the house of doctor pipped
all conocted the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all lin blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
we have come from a fire lontlely er place than this alone leer place
and you must be ojo the unlucky she added
oh jo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life
where travelling replied ojo and les stoff it your house just to rest and werefresh ourselves
the woman seemed thoughtful
and one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling in steaming at a great rate
it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i making it fror my good wife margaralot who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own
you must know said margalot when they were allseated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mumbe the witch who use to leave in the country of te gillikins to the north of here
the first loct we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
i think the next glass cat then magician makes well have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mise and they prove of some use to us
i my fraid i don't know much about the land of us
yousee i ave lived allmy life with a nonkey the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in sympathetic tone
i think i must show you my patch work girl said margalout laughing at the boys ostonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
but first i will tell you that from many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the house work and to cok the meals and wash the dishes
yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
a bed quilt made af patches of different kinds and colours of cloth onleat ly so together
sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
when i found id i said to myself that it would do nicely fror my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colours would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchgins are
at the emerald city where our princess alsimalives green is the popular color
i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
oh jo wexamined this carious contrivance with wonder
margalot had first made the girls form from the patch work quiled and then she had dressed it with tha patch work skirt and in apron with pockets in it using the same game material throughout
the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
the hair was af brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat brains
gold is the most common metal in the land of os and is used for many purposes because it is soft andpliable
no i forgot anl the bout the brains exclaimed the woman
well that may be true agreed margaloc but on the contary a servat with twoo much brains as sure to become in de pendent in high ind mighty and feel above her work
she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles
i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in tha servant
she ran to her husband side at once and helped him lift the fore cattles from the fire
their contents had all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder
very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it alltogether in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon
no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
oh jo became ma bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness
he selected a small gold bottle with e pepperbox top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes
most people talked twoo much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little

in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of bailem's as to speak he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
there was something in his air and demanner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
the ingenious hawky who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to down upon him
come com returned hocki an casing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed
i greatly morned that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly hym can you lead me to him
the task will not be difficult return david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase the mitigate his unhappy fortunes
the lodgein which uncus was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison o uncus wary but close observers of the manner of their captive
delivered an astrong tone of a cent announced the gratification the savage would receive and witnessing such an exhibition of weakness ind an enemy so long hated and so much feared
they drew back a little from the entrance and motion to the supposed conjurer to enter
but the bear instead of obeying maintained the seat of had taken and growled
the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow up on his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hand he received they must stand further off
then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cooquery
onkus occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful withs
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and the singer is is good as nothing
the delawares are children of the tortise and they outstrippe the deer
oncus who had already approached the door and readiness to lead the way now recoiled ind placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
but hawk y who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself tan to his companion
so onchus you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention
as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turne to daven and gave him his parting instructions
my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust as greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettle that so direct and attack on his menhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
if you are not then knocked on the head youre being a non compasor will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
so thoose for yourself to make a rush or terry here
bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out seddenly and one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
if however they take your scoup as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
hold said david prceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
then heving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practice myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
god bless you friend i do believe your send is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping a turnity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation
the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the others features is he afraid
will the herens here his groans
the moheacan started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of chries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
ongess cast a skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrol belegitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely antidiness he was an incomfortable man
i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
i was absent rether more than an hour
the only dupikat which existed so far as i knew it was that which belonged to my servant banister a man who was looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
they all turn ov was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair whill i made a most careful examination of the room
a broken tip of led was lying there also
not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black do or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
to the best of my belief they were rolled up
did any one know that these proofs would be there no one saved the printer
i was in such a hurri to come to you you left your door open
so it seems to me
now mister sulmbs at your disposal
above wore three students one on each story
then he pproached it and standing on tipto with his neck craned he looked into the room
there is no opening except the one paitine said our learned guide
i am afraid there are no signs here said he
one could hardly hope for any upon so dria day
you left him in a chair you say which thair by the window there
the man entered and took the papers shed by shet from the central table
as a matter of fact he could not said solmes for i entered by the side door
how long with a taken to do that using every possible contraction acquarter of an hour not less
then he tassed it down and seized the next
he was in the midst of that when youre return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
mister salmas was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information
homs held out a small chip with the letters an an and the space of clear wood after them you see
what's a ni have always done you and injustice there are others
i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polishe surface no i see nothing
as homes drew the curtain i was aware from some little regidity and anlertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
holms turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor hello what is this
homes hut ed out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stare and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
and they are all in for the examination yes
one heartly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
let us he the suspicions i will look after the proofs
my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
the top floor belongs to males mcclerin
i do not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
he was still suffering from the sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times
did you look at these papers on the table
how came you to leave the key in the door
any one in the room could get out yes sir
i have really don't think he knew much about it mister holmes
only for a minute or so
oh i would not venture to say sir
you haven't seen any of them no sir
it was the indian whose dark silouett appeared suddenly upon his blind
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
the set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
no names please said holmes as we knocked at gilchris door
of course he did not realize that it was y who was nocking but nonetheless his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious
that is very important aitd homes
you don't seem to realize the position
to morrow as the examination
i can ot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
it is possible that i may be an a position then to indicate some course of action
i will take the black clar with me alsor the pennil cuttings good bye
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
the fou moute fellow at the top
he is the one with the worst record
why benister the servant what's his game in the matter
he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders and half humorous resignation
no good my dear watson
i think so you have formed a conclusion
yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
look at that he held out his hand
on the palm were three little pyramids of black dohy clay
and one more this morning
in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the colprit to compete for the valuable scholarship
he could hardly stand still so great was his mental egitation and he ran towards homes with two eager hands outstretched think heaven that you have come
you know him i think so
if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
no sir certainly not
tere was no man sir
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon banister and the farther corner
just close the door said homes
we want to know mister gilchrist how you and honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
for a moment gil christ with upraised hand tried to control his riving features
come come said holme's kindly it is human to air and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
well i'll don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you know and justice
he could examine the papers ind his own office
the hindian i also thought nothing of
when i approached your room i examined the window
no one less than that would have a chance
i entered and i took you into my confidence as to this suggestions of the side table
he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are where with several sharp spikes
no harm would have been done had ad not been that as he passed your door he prceived the keey which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
he put his shoes on the table
gloves said the young man
suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
hove i told the truth mister gilgrust
i have a letter here mister solmes which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
it would be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since syou were left in the room and must have locked the door when you en out
it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
if mister solm saw them the game was up
in the debate between the singiers societies her defense of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and miled climate she was not a verse to charleston or new orleans
john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
better go he had counseld antentiously
might learn something useful down there
but john there's no society just elementary work
been looking up toomb's county
fine some crustwells there big plantations raded it two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
some others too bid cottond county
hou ought to know john if i teach negroes else scarcely see much of people in my own class
at any rate i say go
here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused oldors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable
she wonted a glance of the new books in periodicals and talk of grate ful anthropies ind reforms
so for the hundredh times she was thinking today as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
cotton she bassed
she had almost forgotten that it was here with in touch and sight
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered an murmured before her sretching awit to the northward
it miy be a bit of poor try here and there but most of this place was such desperate prose
her regards shifted to the green stocks and leaves again and she started to move away
cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boyse she said rather primly
miss taylor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remarked seemed called four
don't know will ave all things in wouldly commented miss taylor letter re bornin cotton and o well as much as to ask what's the use she turned again to go
i suppose though it's too early for them then came the explosion
googles don't grow on to tops sadvines but on the ground o new ords like yems is that so
the golden fleece it's the silver fleece he harkened
sometime you tell me please won't you
now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even mat she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing taughtme
the honorable chales smith miss sara's brother was walking swiftly up down from mister easterley's wall street office and his face was pale
at last the cotton combine was to all appearances in assured fact and he was slated for the senate
why should he not be as other men
she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence and others
as she awaited her guess she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and as quiet tude for her social functions were few to night there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james criton the rich english menufacturer and lady criton mister and missus vanderpol mister harry creswell an hiss sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey a selection of guess that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of coden interests earlier in the day
missus gray had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vivid ly there cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made ap point of introducing fourth with
she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister crestwell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
do you believe in some education asked mary taylor
i believe in the train in the people to ther haits capacity the englishmen here hartily seconded him
but creswell added significantly copacity diffes in normous li between racees
the bandor pools were sure of this and the englishman instancing india became quite eloquent missus gray was mistified but hardly dared admit et the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest crutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
wals a timley her awic added criswell avoiding his sisters eyes
but we're not a exactly welcome
marry taylor however related the tail of sor to missus gray's private ear later
for tunately said mister vanderfol nor ther nose and sawtinors all ribing at a belof mutual understanding on most of these matters
he knew the silver fleese his ansor as must be ruined
it was the first great sorrow of his life it was not so much the loss of the cottin itself but the fantasy the whopes the dreams built around it
ah the swamp the cruel swamp
the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly tol it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him ind burning wonder
he panted to know if she too knew or new and cared not or cared and knew not
she was so strange an human accreature
the world was water beiled in mists
then if was sudden admid day the sun shot out hod and still no breath of air stirred the sgy was like lue steel the earth steamed
where was the use of imagining
the lagood had been level with the dikes a week ago and now
perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
he plashed to stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the ramp art of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
then he looked down the lagoon was dry
he stood a moment bewoldered then turned and rushed upon the eisland a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept a place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green thic tall wet and willowy
the squares of codd an sharp edge heavy were just about to burst to bulls
but one long moment he paused stupid again with utter amazement then lane dizzly against the tree
he gazed about put bleced astonished
here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain someone had dug a an now from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and cocked way thus allowing it to empty directly
he sat down weak the wildered and one thought was up er most soara
the years of the days of her dying were ten
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
up in the sick roomes or lay on the little whide bed
the ned and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strole for her life wosh narled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
for while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure it son and bird and tree
she roles with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulus slipped across the road and into the swamp
she had been born within its borders within his border she had lived ind groan and within its border she had met her love
ont she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island low the cotton laborfore her
the chair was empty but he knew
he darted through the trees and pawsed a tall man strongly but slimly made
it is a very fin old place of red brick softened by a pale powdery liken which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables the windows and the door place
but the windows are patched with wooden pains and the door i think is like the gate it is never opened
for it is a solid heavy handsome door and must once have been in the habit of shedding with a sonrous bang behind the livery blackey who had just seen as master and misters off the grounds in a carriage and par
a large opene fireplace with resty dogs in it and a barer boarded floor at the far end fleeces of wolves sbacked up in the middle of the floor some empty cornbags
and what through the left hand window
several clothes morses a pillion a spenning wale and an old box whyde open and stuffed full of coloured rags
at the edge of this box their lives a great wooden dall which so far as mudilation is concern bears a strong resemblance to the finest greek sculpture and especially in the total loss of its nose
the history of the house is plain now
but there is always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain and now he is pouring down his beams and making sparkles among the wet straw and lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the couched and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow billed ducks who are seasing the opportunity of gitting the grink with as much body in it as possible

hathe surl often took the opportunity when her aunt's back was turned of looking at the pleacing reflection of herself in those polished services for the oak table was usrally turned up like a screen and was more for arnament than for use and she could see herself sometimes in the great round peterdishes there were ranged on the shells above the long deal dinner table or in the hobs of the great which always shone like jasper
do not suppose however that missus poyser was elderly or shrewish and her appearance she was a good looking woman not more than eight and thirty a fair complexion and sandy haire whell shapen light footed
the family like this between her and her knees dina moris with e contrast between her keenness and dinas surrafhic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary
her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a dame sol came with ag or shot seemed to take up an unfinished luxure as a barrel organ takes up a tune perecisely at the point where it had left off
the fact that it was turning day was another reason why it was inconvenient to have the wid ows and why i consequently missus poiser should scold molly the house made with unusual severity
to all appearance molly had got through her after dinner work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to asks submissivly if she should sit down to her spinning till miltingtime
spinning indeed
i never knew your equals for gallowsness
who taught you te scrub a floor a should like to know
comb the wolf for the wio ows indeed
that's what she'd like to be doing is that
that's the way with you that's the road you'd all like to go headlongs to ruin

no no no tadty bitter feet wet said missus poyser carrying away her iron
did ever anybody see the like screamed missus poyser running towards the table when her ei had fallen on the blue stream
toddy however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of wabbling run and an a mount of fat on the neieb of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig
and she was very found of you too an rechel
i often heard her talk of you and the same sort of way
which he had that ban illness and i was only e leven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if i'm taken from you for she has a kind heart and i'm sure i've found it so
and there's linden in the house as i could well spare you for i got lots of sheeting and table clothing and towling s isn't made up
but not more than what's in the bible and said dina
mader and you never heard me say that all people are called to her sake their work in their families
we can all be servants of god wherever our lot is cast but he gives us different sorts of work the cording as he fit us for it ind pulseus to it
i can no more helps spending my mife in trying to do what i can for the souls of others then you could help running if you heard little toddy crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her
i ave strong as surents that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children fror anything i have done
i didn't preach without direction
direction
i had a common patience with you
by this time the twea gentleman had reached the palings ind had got down from their horses he was playin they meant to come in

o ser dot mention it said miti's poycer

said captain danny thorne sitting himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door
no sir he isn't he's gone to roseter to see mister west the factor about the woll
but there father in the barn sir if he'd be of any use
no thank you i'll just look at the welbs and leave a message about them with your shepherd
i must come annother day and see your husband i want to have a consultation with him about horses
for if his anywhere in the farm we consend for him in a minute
oh sir said missus poyser rather larmed you wouldn't like it at all
but you know more about that than i do sir
i think i should be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place
i knowce marm is in better order than any other with in ten miles of us than as for the kitchen he added smiling i don't believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it
by the by i've never seen your dary i must see your dairy missus poyser

the dynamo electric machine bot small was robust for under all the variing speeds of waterpower and the pecissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years
owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers an a son has been frequently spoken of as annaponent of the alternating courret
why if we erect a station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
there seems no good reason for believing that it will change
broad as the prairies and free and thought as the winds that swept them he is pidyo in cratically upposed to loosen wastful methods to plans e vempire that neglect the poor at the gate
everything he has done has been amed at the concervation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against its seriously
it could not be used for electoral plating or deposition nor could it charge to rige batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the directurrent
but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts ar remote country resevens or a far mouse the alternating currents in all elements save its danger was and is ideal
at isson was in tolerant of shamm on shaddi and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope tes tube and galvanometer
unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governent regulated than those available for his dinamo and lamp at ason realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light
mister addison was a leader far ahead of the time
he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction break also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator of verify it
then again there was no nown way to lupricate an engin for continuous running and mister edison and form me  that as i marine engines started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times
andison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multiple arch system covered by his feeter and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against ha straight to wire system throughout of the tree kind
he soon foresaw that still greater aconomy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact district of large cities
the strong position held by the edison's system under the strenuous competition it was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and et gave an immediate empothus to incondicent lighting
it was spetially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when te yield of six or eight lamps to the horse bower was considere subject for congratulation
the street conductors were of the overhead poll lime construction adwar in stalled by the construction company that had been organized by adison to build an equips entral stations
meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wir sistem known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent and vendors at practically the same time
i think he was perhaps more appreciative that i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up
but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
they were later used as reserve bachines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edesonia but they remaine in practically as good condition as one installed in eighteen eighty three
the arc labp and stalled outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public streetlighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lap might be out through accident
evison held that the electricity sould must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
there was infinite skepticism around him on the subject and while other invettors were also giving the subject bherthought the public took it for granted that any thing so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weded and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration
hence the adison electoralitic meter is no longer used despite its axcellent qualities
the principale employed in the adison electoralitic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to deacompose a chemical substance
associated with thes simple form of apparatus were various in genious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit thaft of current or damage
the standard adison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted
in thecember eighteen eighty eight mister duw j jecks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other
the others having been an operation to short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis
in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of adison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the adnison mader was accurate and that it's use was not expensive for stations anbove one thousand lights and that the best financial results were in variably secured an a station selling current by meter
the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
he waiged at rewave the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
he felld he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would sut himbetter
the problem was solved
we were more interested in the technical condition of the station that in the commercial part
we had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid

how did her mother ever let her go
she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
id difn't have any fears if i worked to priely said the old gentleman complacently
he cried and highe dudgeen just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his mancy
and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigerously

indeed he had looked away with the purpose of noxseing it
they think your proud because you've been away to school or something
there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange had his their glassy dreen mocking off the yellow fields
any one dhere about would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the devide and that the farmer was a woman alexandrabergson

and amial mone his way slowly down toward the cherry trees
that summer the reins had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his men could do that heep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness
i don't know all of them but i know then an zar
if i feel that way i feel that way
he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet incipid fruit long ivery coloured barries tipped with maint pink like white carrel that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
he dropped a handful into her lap

saturday ougust fifteen the sea and broke in all round no land in sight
the horizon seemed extremely distant
ol my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well is nature has resumed its sway
you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious
one might be woth less reason than now
i hav not complaiting that the rat is slow but that the seat is so wide
we are losing time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little saile upon a pulon on a raft
he called the sea apo and i long uwaye taking a little sail
therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
i take this as my auntswer and i leave to professor to buite his lips with impatience
sunday august sixteenth
nothing knew whether unchanged the wind freshes
but there seemed no reason to fear
the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
truly the sea is of infinite wit
the must be is wide as the mediterranean wor they atlantic and why not
these thoughts additated me all day in my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleeve
i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
i saw at the hamberg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
i suppose professor leadon brock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pig his eyes ter ferse the ocean from side teside
twosday august eighteenth
during his watch i slept
two hours afterwards a terrible shock a wote me
tho wraft was headed up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
there's a whale awale cried the professor
fight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they willed around our little raft with a repidity greater than that of expressed trads
two monsters only recreating all this commotion and before my eyes are to rephiles of the primitive world
i can distinguish the eye of th ictheassourus glowing like a red hot co and his large as a man's head
it's jaw is e normous and according to naturalists is arned with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth
those huge creatures attack each other with a greatest animosity
suddenly the icteossourus and the plecius sourus disappear bellow leaving a war poll eddiing in the water
as for the if the assourus as he returned whose submarine cabern
the rowings become last in the distance
the weather if we may use the term will change before lawn
the atmosphere is charged with vapors prvaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of sailing waters
the electric light con scarcely penetrate trough the dence curn which is dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged
the air is heavy the sea is calm
from time tho time a flicy toufh of mise with yet some gleaming light left upon it trop down upon the dence floor of gray and loses itself in the ophag and a peneterable mass
the atmosphere as evidently charged and searh charged fir the lectricity
the wind ever lolled but to acquire increased strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts in rushing storms
there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
those cloud seem as if they were going to crush the sea
on the mast already i see the light play of a lamin it saint ar will'sfire the outstritch saile catches non a breadth of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead
but if we have now ceased to advance whie do we at leave that sale loose which at the first shock of a tempest mecapsize us in a moment
that will be the safeest no no never
the pold of vapors contents in ta water and the air put in the violet action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mist rouses itself into a wirldwin
harnsters not
from the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid life electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molicules bhe gashes elements of the air need to be slaved with moisture for innermable columns of water rushed upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
i referred o the thermometer it indicates the figure is o bliteratedg

the raft bears an still to the southeast
at noon the violence of the storm redoubled
each of us is lash to some part of the raft
the waves rise above our heads
tuy seeme to be we are lost but i am not sure
he nods his consent
the far ball half of it wide half azere blue and the sizes of a ten inch shell moved soly about the raft but revolving on its own acess with thestonishing philocity as if whip round by the force of the worlwind
here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast that's it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skims the powder magazine orrible
we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches harns who fixes his blue eye upon its sedily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it
a suffocating smell of nigtroted fills the air it enters the throat it fills the longs

it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed t the pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along and a great hurry mutdering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
oh what she be servage if i've kept her waiting
i was took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept panning her self all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day

i am so very tired of being all alone here
and i declare it's too bad that it is

i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being trowned in my own tears
that will be a queer thing to be sure
i am very tired of swimming about here oh mouse
cried aliceagain for this time the mouse was prsling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
we won't talk about her any more if he'd rather not we indeed
we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it
the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther and less we make an talk as you would talk to day to americans
let us begin with that his commentary ongalations
the undertaking which seemed so attractive when biewed as a literary task proved the most difficult one an at times became a precsive
it was written in latin
the work had to be condensed
a word should now be said about the origin of luther's commentary ungulations
much later when a friend of his was preparing an addition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine mygelations fornstance
inother words these three men took dhown the lecures which lutheradressed to his students in the course of galations and roer prepared the manuscript for the printer
the presents like no other of luther's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ merits alone
but the essence of luther's lectures is there
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us power to serve and to do lop to
the word of our god shall stand forever
in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul
they said to the galations you have no right to think highly ofppaul
he was the last aturned o crist
polking later in his beneath us
indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
do you suppose they god for the sake of a few moothren heretics would thes emone his entire church
against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defense his apostolic authority in ministry
as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exult his office in order to gain a uthority among men
paltics pridein his ministry not to his own praise but to the prise of god
paul and a postle not of men et cetera
either he calls ministers through the agency of men or ecalse them directly as he called the profits an apostles
pald the clars of the false apostles were called hersent neither by men nor by man
the most they could claim is that there were semply others
he mentiones the apostles first because they were appointed direct the by god
the call was not to be taken lightly
for person the possess knowledge is not enough
is spoils one's best work
when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call
i did not then realize the importance of the ministry
i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught so fistrene set of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting
this is no sinful pride it is wholly pride
in god the father who raised him from the dead
the classemed superfulous on first sight
these pervertors of the righesness of christ resist the father and the sun and the works of them both
in this whole pestle paultreats of the resurrection of christ
by his resurrection crist won the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell in every evil
first two
and all the breth room which are with me
this should go far and shetting them mouse of the fals apostles
although the brethrin with me ore not a possles like myself yet they are all af one mind with me think right and teach as i do
they do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate they go vere the cuestions are
why did they not invade the catholic provinces in preach their doctrine to god was princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god
we look for that reward which i have not seen nor ear heard neither havh entered into the heart of man
not all the galations had become prverted
these means cannot be contaminated
they remained divine regardless of men's opinion
wherever the means of grac er found there is the holy church even though anti crise reins there
so much for the title of the epistole now follows the greeding of the apostlee verse three
grace be too you and peace from god the father and from our bord jhesus christ
the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul an are now pretty well understood
the greating of the apostles prefreshing
grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience
the world brands this a pernicious doctrine
experience proves this
however the grace and piece of god will
men should not speculate about the nature of god
was it not enough to say from god the father
to do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure into comprehend his infinite majesty
he came down to earth lifed among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him
embrace him and forget about the nature of god
did not crist himself say i am the way in the truth and the life no man come with unto the father but by me
when you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like
we are to hear christ to has been appointed by the father as our divined teacher
at the same time palkanfirms are creed that christ is very god
that crist is very god is apparent in that paul scribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power do the spense grace and peace
to bestow peacing grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot
otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our bord jesus christ
the arians took chice for a noble and perfect reacur superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth
mohammad also speaks highly of christ
passtixs to his theme
he never loses sight of the purpose of his opistle
not gold or silver or passial lambs or n angel but himself what four
not for a crown or a kingdom or ar goodness before sins
underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences
how may we obtain temission of our sins
pauliansers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sinse
since christ was given for our sins at stands to reason that they calnot be put away by our own efforts
this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make ammends for a single sin
the greatness of the ransom christ some a god indicates this
the vicious character of san his brought out by the words who gave himself for r sinse
but we are careless we make light of sin
we think that by some little work or merri we can dismiss in
this passage then bears ut the fact that all men are sold an der sin
this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that san is a small matter easily takin care of by good works that we must present ourselves onto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before may feel that christ was given for our sense
the satitude is universal in particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others
but the real significance in comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them
on the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair
he passes a bruptly from persons tho ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers the persons from the heavens to men from a stronomy to physiology he confuses a rather does not distinguish subject in object first and final causes and is dreaming of juw metrical figures lost in a flios of sense
but influence which too to me is has exercised upon besterity is du partly to a misunderstanding
in the suppose teths of this dialogue the neo platinests found hidden meanings ind connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quiet at variante with the spirit of plato
they were absorbed in his theology and where under the do minion of his name while that which was truly great in truly correct ristic in him his effort to realize in connect ofstrections was not understood by them at all
there is no danger of the mardern commentators on the temeas falling into the ibbisurdities of the new yo platnests
in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
the fancies of the neo pladnists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a fase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own tay
but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spide they are apposed to him
we do not know how pla to would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the totrillogis which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavily bodies and with man unly as one among the enimals
but he has not as yet the fined this antemediate territory which lies some were between medicine and methematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in rinking feries of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
with heratlitis he acknowledges the perpetual flooks like an excageros he is served the predominance of mine although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subdoing lite the pifigorians he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
many if not all the elements of the prie so cretic philosophy are included in the timeas
it is sprobable that the relation of the ideis to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
the ideas also remained but they have become types in nature forms of men animal spurts fishes
the style and plen of the tomeis tifferd greatly from bad of any other of the platanic dialogues
but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which hakes imits in the fedres or simposium
nothing can exceed the beauty or arbe of introduction in which his using words after his accustomed manner
but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is holdi given up
he could ride in one style but not in a nother tan the greek language had not as yet mean fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
in hence we find the same sort of quosin us in the temeos of plato which charact arizes the philosophical poem of the cricious
there is a ont of slow an often a defect of ribhen the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a grater use of epposition in more of repetition than occurs in playtols earlier ritings
playtol had not the command of his materials which would have eabled him to produce a perfect work of art
so rites begins to to me as with a summary of the republic

but aready at e point en economic evolution far and stating the emergence of the lady specialized consemption of a goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a moreol ess celebrite system
the utality of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivotive growth
such consumption as fals trough the women is mellion siddental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not to consemption directed to the own comfort and fullness of life
with the farther advance and culchure this to be may change  into simple custom of a moreor less fregrous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be at a bu or a large conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
in the nature of things lexuries and the comforts of life blong to the leisure class
under the taboo saiden victels and more paticularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
grenkiness and the other pathological consequences of the free ears of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become unerific as being a marke at the second remove of the superior stateus of those who are able to afford the indulgence
it has even happened that the name for certain disease conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonum for noble or gentle
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
with many quofifications with more quolifications as the patriarcal tradition has gradually weakened the general rute is fell to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household pereprenalia is an obvious exception to this roome but it will appear in the sequel dis ecception is much more obvious and substantial
the custom of testiv gatherings probably ariginated in motives of commidiality and religion these moatives are also present in the late development tut they do not continue to be the soul motives
there is a more al as alaborate system of ranking grates
this de frentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequente inheritance of gentlity
many of these affiliated gentlemen of lisure are the same time less a men of substance in the rown right so that some of them are scarcely at all aether sonly partilly to be rated as vi carious consumers
se many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as i carious consumer without qualification
many of these again and also many of the other are strucracy of listi grye having turn a toched to the persons ad more or less comprehensive group of i carious consumer in the persons of their wifes and children their servants retain ers et cetera
the wearing of uniforms are liveries implies e considerable degree of dependence and maveen be said to be amark of servitude real are astensible
the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be reftly divided into twoo classes the free and the servine were the noble and the ignoble
but the general distinction is not a tatter count to be overlooked
so those officers which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms an a cutrments and the like in short those switch may be classed as sustensibly predatory employments
i never as in these cases the menial service ing question has to de directly with a primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected onarific character
the livery becomes obnoxious tuneally oll who are required to wear it
in a general way though not tollly nor consistently these two groups coincide
the dependent who was first delegated for these stuties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in ta lated development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarly performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
but as we descemd the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarous leasure in consumption devolve upon the wife alone
in the communitys of the western culture this point is a present found among the low imiddle class
if beautyor comfort is achieved and it is more al less portutous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves through th great economic law of wasted effort
the man of the household also can do something in thes direcion and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtualy seize to consume valuable goods for apearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household pecuniaritecency
very much of squallorand discomfort will be indured before the last trink et or the last pretence of pecunaritie sincees put away
there is no class an no country that as yielded so obdectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the person's whose comvictions it is desired to affect
each will there fore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
the mudernerganization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the diraktion of hihtening the utility of conspicous consumption as compared with leisure
it is also noticable that the surv sibility of consumption is a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community wheth human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
consemption becomes a larger element in the sander of living in the city than in the country
among the country population its places to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighbored gossips sufficiently to serve the light general purpose of pecuniary repuit
the result is a great mability of the labor imploint in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well define and consetrable buddy of workmen
under the simple test of affectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consemption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary amulation pretty evenly between the atthe outset
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came toold e rank faramet above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and das an element in the standard of decency during the course i peaceful culture
are the circumstance permitting that instinct dispose s men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use
i reconciliation between the two conflict ting requirements is affected by resort to make believs men and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations ave founded with some specious object of amiliration and bodied in their official styl entitle ther is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the tack is may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effect cial economic value of their traffic
the sailent features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
throughout the entire evolution of conspicious expenditure whether of good sar of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to affectually mend the consumer's good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities
as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of depprecation
the use of the wood waste as a technical term therefore impries no deprecation of the motives or of the end' sart by the constumer under this canon of conspicuous waste
but it is another grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of every day life implies therprication of what is characterized a suastepull
in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicious waste but such expenditure as his encured in the grond of an invitious pecuniary comparison
and artica may be useful in wastful both and it's setelited to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions

the christmas holidays came and she and and returned to the parsonage and to that happy home sircle in which alone ther natures expanded amongst all other people they shriveled thap more or less
indeed there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters wot producing the same result

a good neighbor of the brontes a clever intelligent yorkshure woman who keeps a drugis shop ind hawl worth from er occupation her experience and excellent sense holds the position of village doctress and nurse and as such has been a friend in many a time of trial and sickness and death in the households round told me a characteristic little incident connected with tabby's ractured leg
tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was as charlotte expressed it one of the family
he refuse aut first to listen to the careful advice it was repugnant to his liberal nature
this decision was communicated to the girls
tabby had tended them in their childhood they and none other should tend her in her infirmity in age
atd te time they were sad and silent and the meal went away and touched by any of the three
she had another wayht on her mind this cristmas

i doubt whether bronwell was maintaining himself at this time
to celebrate the arrival of her son sylvia gave a splendid supper to which he had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself and ut lustrious member of the republic of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect
in order to please her i spoke to her of the abbey conti and i had occasion to quote too lines of that profound writer
madame corrected me with a patronising air for my pronunciation of the word scomvra which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced scure and she added that i ought to be very glad to have learned so much in the first day of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
her face was in a igma ford in spired every one with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she could not be called handsome but no one could have thought her ugly
sylvia was the adiration of france and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the playse of marivo for without her his comedies would never have gone to prosterity
sylvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because herself love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
two years before her death i saw her berform thet character of marry anne in the comedy of meravox and in spite of her age and declining health the allusion was complete
she was honourably buried in the church of saint sovere without the sightest opposition from the venerable priest who far from sharing the anti christian intolerance hy of the clergy in general said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and that the earth was a common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind
you will forgive me dear reader if i have made you a tend the funeral of sylvia ten years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing the miracle you may consol yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor sylvia dies
i never had any family
i had a name i believe in my young days but i have forgotten it since i have been in service

then turning towards me he says that i ha looe like a foreigner and when i say that i am an italian e begins to speak to me of the court he city of the theatres and at last he offers to accompany me everywhere
i think him and take my leave
i address him in a talian and he answers very wittirly but his wavof speaking makes me smile and i tell him why
my remark pleases him but i soon proved to him that it is not the right way to speak however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer

you are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article in the first case it receives the welcom of intelligent and talented people and in the second fools are always ready to reward it for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear sillinness is the daughter of whit

on the sixth of april eighteen thirty the church of jesus prist of latterday saints was formerly organized and thus took on a legal existence
its origin was small a germ and insignificant seed hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition
instead of but six regularly affiliated members and at most two squore of adherence the organization numbers to day many hundred thousand souls
in place of a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have comgligated ther now are about seventy stakes of zion and about seven hundred organized wards each ward and stake with its full compliment of officers and presed organizations
the practice of gathering its proselites into one place prevents the building up and strengthening afford branches and in his much as extencive and strong organizations are seldom thet with a broad very ironeous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church
nevertheless the mustard seed among the smallest of all seats hasitated the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acord is now in oak offering protection and thi sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pogrim journeying its way for truth
ther eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun not merely that the work of prosletting should be carried on in the west but tat the headquarters of the church should be there astablished
the book a mormon had taught that people the true horrigon and destiny of the american indians and toward this dark skined remnant of a once mighty people the missionaries of mormonism early turned their eyes and with her eyes wint their hearts and their hopes
it is notable that the indian tribes have carely regarded their religion of the latter day saints with favour seeing in the book a mormon striking agreement with heir own traditions
the first well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of curtlind ohio almost within sight of lake eerie it here soon rose the first temple of modern times
to the fervent laterday saint a temple is not simply a church building and house for religious assembly
soon thousands of converts had rented or purchased homes and missouri a dependence jackson county being their center but from the first they were unpopular among the missourians

beit said to the honour of some of the officers in trusted with a terrible commission that when they learned its true significance they resign their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold blooded butchery
oh what a record to read what a picture te gaze apon how awful the fact
american school boys read with emotions of horror of the albirgenzes driven beaten and killed with a pepa leggate directing the butchery and nofthe thog dwa hunted and howded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scens as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate
who began the quarrel was at the mormons
as the sable of the press comments against at the brutality of the missourians i quote apparagraphs from the quincy arguss march sixteen eighteen thirty nine
it will be observed that in organized mob aided by many of the civil and military officers of missouri with governor bogs at their head have been the prominent actors in this business incited two it appears against them mormons bi political hatred and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge
the army found that people in poverty and left them ind comparative wealth

it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one niv yet to find the place and meet the people where in with whom the purity of man and woman his held more precious than among the meligned moremons in the mountain valleys of the west
at the inception of porol marriage mong the latterday saints there was no law national or state against its practice
in eighteen sixty two a law was inacted with a purpose of suppressing woreld marriage and as had been predicted in the national senate priyor to its passage at lay tor many years had dead letter
federal judges and united states hattorneys and newtap who were not mormons nor lovers have marmonism refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest in justice and inadequacy
this bent that foran illeged mister meanor for which congress prescribed a maximum pedalty of six months on prisoment and a fine of three hundred dollars a man might be im prison for life i for many terms of aman's natural life ti the court's power to enforce its sentences extens so far and might be fined millions of dollars
tefore this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and their met with the reversal and rebukeat deserved bhenwere prisoned under sentence of many years duration
the people contessed these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure
then the church was disincorporated and its property woll real and personal confisicated and is shiated to the government of the united states and although the personal property was soon restored real estate of grate value long lay in the hands of the courts receiver and the morman church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property
and so the story of mormonism runs on its fanali has not yet been written the current press presents continuously new stages of its progress new developments of its plan

what she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our franks but just are youth

the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both
bartley started when held arang a little bell beside her dear me why did you do that
it was very jolly he murmured lasily as marie came in to take away the coffee

when she finished alexander shook himself out of a reveree
nonsense of course i can't relyse sing except the way my mother and grandmother did before me
it's really to warm in the srom to sing don't you feel it
alexander went over and opened the window for her
there just in front
he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it soft and misty see how wite the stars are
for a long time e the hild the nor bartley spoke
he felt a tremmor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him
bartly leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you are giving me a chance yes
alexander clunched the two hands at his sides
the stop it queen's town the tedious passage of the mercy were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
she blushed in smiled and fonbled his card in her confusion before she ran up stairs
alexander pased up and down the hallway buttening and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hilld his living room
the room was empty when he entered
alexander did not sit down
i felt it in my bones when i woke this morning that something splendit was going to turn up

when did you come bart lay and how did it happen you have 't spoken a word
i got in about ten minutes ago
alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
bartly bent lowered over the fire
she looked at his heavy shoulders and bigged determined head brusted forward like a catapulein lash
i'll do anything you wish me too bartley she said tremelously
i can't stand seeing you miserable
he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
hill to watch him from the corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes it
but it's worse now it's unbearable

ruth sat quite still for a time with face and tent and flushed it was out now
the sights years returned in high spirits from the city
ruth asked the entthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding muszlium with its great halls and equig rrooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body
and then there was broad street
there are certainly was no into it and even ruth was philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end for architectural blant uppon which the weary eye could rest
but neither saint derard nor broad street neither wonders of the ment nor the glories of the hall were the ghost of our father sit always signing the decklaration impresse the visitor so much as the splendors of the chest nut street windows and the bargains on eighth street

so there is to me addid sanferd with a sarcastics near
and yet you must own her behaviour has warnted them has it not been in this particular incoherent and unaccountable
not that i know of not one more that i know of he replied with astonishment at what she had insinuated and yet wite a perfect exsurance that she was in the wrong
perhaps i am mistaken answered she
to ask any more questions of you i believe would be unfair
he seemed to wait for her reply but as she made none he peroceeded
oh my lord cried miss woodley with a must forcible accent you are the last personal honeartf she would pardon me for interusting
but in such a case miss milner's election of a husband shall not direct mine
if she does not know how to estimate her own value i do
in the penent of her fortune she has beauty to captivate the heart of any man a with a her follies she has a frankness in her manner an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts of a vacity in her conversation and withall a softness in her demeanour that might alone engage the effections of a man of the nicest sentiments and the strongest understanding
my lord miss miller's taste does not a depraved one it is but to refind
what can you mean by that miss woodley you talk mysteriously
id she not afraid that i will fwart her inclinations
again he searched his own thoughts nor in affectually as before
miss woodley was too little verst in the subject to know this would have been not to love at all at least not to the extent of breaking through engagements and all the various obstacles that still mitigated against their union
to relieve her from both he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said do you believe me
i will make no onjust use of what i know he replied with firmness i believe you my lord
i have never yet however been vanquished by them and even upon this occasion my reason shall come bat them to the last and my reason shall fail me be fore i do wrong

once an action he was leaving at de tachment of infantry through an intrenchment
sometimes he would wander on foot upon the sandy shore and sometimes he would enjoy a ride among the summit of the cliff altogether being in no hurry at all to bring his task to an end
no cathedral ot even burgos itself could vie with e church at mont marchar
bensofs most ambitious desire wes to enduce the captain to go with him and end his days in his much loved home and so incessitly were serveidax ears besieged with the scriptions of the unparallel beauties and advantages of this eighteenth our ondesymo of paris that he could scarcely hear the name of montmarchra without a conscious thrill of a version
when a private in the ape cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac
the bond of union thus affected could never be severed and although bensoff's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer
a mik his master he made no pretension to any gift of poetic power but his inexhaussible memory made him a living in cyclopedia and for his stock of anecdotes and troopers tals he was matchless
vast as his legs could carry him serve a dack had made his way to the top of the cliff
it was quite true that a vessel was insight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the top mass alone was visible above the water
exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope
she is undersaile but she is count timishef's yacht he was right
if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival
he reckoned therefore not only upon anscertaining the extent of the late atastrophe but upon learning its cause
the wind being adverse the dobrena did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold the steady course
servadack took it for granted that the dogrina was endeavoring to put in
a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the rougfest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters
slightly changing her course she first struck her main sail and in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her two top sails rigantine an jib
captain servadack hastened toward him
i left you on a contimnent and here i have the honour of finding you on an island
never mind now intrposed the captain n we will talk of that by and buy
nothing more than you know yourself
are you certain that this is the mediterranean
for some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied and then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions
to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements
you will take me on board count will you not
my yard is at your service sir even should you require to make a tour round the world
the count shook his head
before starting it was indispensible but the engine of the dugrena should be repaired to saile under canvus only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult
it was on the last ey of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed
a slight dimmunution i may eccessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alterration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide
doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for bensoof to accompany his master
her sea going qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe
after an opprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant an mecount appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by farther greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
the late estounding events however had rendered procope manifastly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety
steam up and canvas spread the scooner started eastwards
although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the demmunution t in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particle so boyant that by the mere effect of oscilation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by be coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
the law hen thec compass therefore where able to be called upon to do the work of the sextent which had become utterly useless
there's no far of that sir

and what demonstration do you offer asked serve a ack eagerly that it will not happen
ocean reigned supreme
all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts spead away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the adgerian watropolis
his it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely
would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible
another circumstance was most remarkable
to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth o from for ti five fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in the emmy degree to what would be expected over the sight of a city that had been terrassed like the seats of an empatheatre
you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined
after pondering a while he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fabhoms five fathoms
its depth remained in variable still four or at most five fathoms and although it's bottom was a siduously dredged it was only to prove it bearon of marine production of any type
nothing was to be done but to put about and return and disappointment toward the north

he had his hand upon lake shoulder
their cousins you know we are all cousins
whatever lord chelford said miss brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile
but her greeting to captain leake was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features i fancied particularly proud and pale
at dinner leake was easy of amusing

by this time bor chelfard amalder returned and disgusted rather with myself i ruminated on my want of generalship
and he made a little dip of his cane towards branded hall over his shoulder
he asked so they said but that would i think have been worse
it ol fellow's been a little bit wild he as beonds a bovet once
proctens a very good fellow i can assure you
i don't know when can't say how you find gentlemen to find wickedness only as an obscure female i speak according to my lights and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county
while you know rady women like wicked fellows it is contrast i suppose but they do and i'm sure from what bract in has said to me i know him intimately that dorcis likes him and i can't cenceive why they are not married
there wal continued silent for the greater part neither was quite satisfied with the other but rachel at last said
now that's impossible ready for i really don't think i once thought of him all the sevening except just wally wore talking
there was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging bowhs and witheredleaves and the modl bites and shadows glided oddly across his palefeatures
don't insult me stanley by talking again at yo did this morning
when i say is altogether on your own account
mark my words your find him too strong for you i and two deep
i 'm very uneasy about it butever it is i can't help it
to my mind there is always been something inexpressibly awful in family fus
the mystery of their origin ther capacity for evolving leden faculties of crime and the stedy bytality with which they survive the herse and speak their deep mouth middlinitees in every newborne generation have associatd them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and e special say tack action
the floor more than anything else showed the great age of the room
my bad was unexceptional belid comfortable but in my vhen mood i could hav wished it a great deal more modern
it's curntins were a thick and feet ed tapistry
all the frniture of belonged to other times
i shan't trouble you about my train of thoughts or fancies but i began to feel very like a gentleman in the ghost story watching experimentally in a haunted chaberer
i did not even take the pecaution of smoking up the chimney
i bullblelighted my te route
a cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows
the sumber old trees like jigantic herse pluomes black and awful
somehow i had grown nervous
a little bit of plaster tumble den the chimney and startled me confoundedly
it was not very much passed eleven that morning when the pony carriage from brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of redmont's farm
while she was better though she had had a bad night
so there came a step and a little rustling of feminin dreeperies the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pail smile of golcam
women can hide their pain better than we men and bar it better too except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice
but poor rachel lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which ennables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
this transit spring and lighting up are beautiful a glambour beguidling our senses
there was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones an manner which was nutery chol and comforting and she returned the greating as kindly and felt more like her former self
rachel's pale and sharpend features and dilydid ye struck her with a painful surprise
he was been so ale my poor rechel
ill and trouble dear troubled in mind and miserably nervous
poor rechel heard nature recoiled from deceit and she told at allevents as much of the truth as she dared
she spoke with a sudden energy which partook a fear and passion and flushed her thing cheek and made her languid eyes flash
thank you rachel my cousin rachel my only friend
chelford had a note from mister walder this morning another note his coming delayed and something of his having do see some person who was abroad continued dorkess after a little pause
yes something everything said rachel hearredly looking frowndingly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers
yes said rachel
and the wane oracl having spoken she sat down in the same sort of obstraction again beside dorkus and she looked full in her cousin's eyes
of mark wilder i say gues his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this bhat you will never ask me to speak again about him
it is an antipathy and intipathy i can not get over dear dorguess you may think it a madness but don't blame me
i have very few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you
and she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and breeveery chol at last burst into tears
dorguess in her strange way was moved
i like you still rachel i'm sure i'll always like you
you resemble me rachel you are fearless and inflexible and generous
yes rachel i do love you
dhink you darkastear
he began ta confused complaint against the wizard who advantished behind the curtain on the left

he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and robin felt his fingers tightend upon his arm

but whos tis fellow plucky it was speeve

mistress fitzoth had been carried off by the sheriffes daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that brouh in alone had the care of molti she

he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm
now to bed boy

as any in angland ie would say said kenewell proudly that is in his day
yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come
there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to gam well's chamber
precently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
will cried he softly and stuttly who had chose in his couch across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once an answer
we will go out together to the bower there is a way down to the cort rom my window
rest and be still until a warn you
the hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard about the hall
at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gamewell
will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a save crossing of the stable roofs
robin entered the hot dragging the unwilling esquire after him
be not so foolish friend said fittuoth crossly
they moved there after cautiously about the hut groping before and about them to find something to show that the warrant in idfulfilled as mission
there were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuttly ha tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit
fittuths hand rested at last upon the top rumn of a ladter and slowly the truth came to him
robin carefully descended the latter ind found himself soon upon firm brocky ground
studtly was by his side in the flash and then they both began feeling about them to as certain the shape and character of this fault
from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrantons
save me master's but you startled me rarely
cried he waving the lanthern before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him
inquired robin with his suspicion still upon him
truly such a horse would be worth much and notting him fair
day nad lording antered morrinton with a half laugh
warrant an spoke thus with significance to show rob in that he was not to think jeffrey's claimed to the estate would be passed by
robind fitsoth saw that his doubts of warrn in had been onfair and he became machamed to himself for harporing them
his tones rang pleasantly onwarrantans ears and fourth with the good fellowship was haralded between them
the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gaimwill at this passage way led from the hut in the pleasants to shurwood and that jeffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
he implores us to be disgreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life as in the hollow of our hands
they regain their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gainwell
out in the woods stood a nice little fur tree
the plac he had was a very good one the sun shown on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs
he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hair would often come leaping along and jumped right over the little tree
oh that made him so angry
to grow and grow to get oldr and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most lightful thing in the world
in autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
this happened every year and the young furtry that had now grown to a very comply sized trembled the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and beare they were hardly to be recognized and then they were ladin carts and the horses dragged othem out of the wood
have you not met the many were
rejoice in ty growth said the sunbeams
and then what happens then
i would fay no if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
i am now tall in my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
were i but old ready on the cart
were i in the warm room with all the splendor an magnificence
yes and something better something still grandler will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ortament me
something better something still grander must follow but what
brechoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight
rejoice in my own fresh youth
but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter in summer
and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pang as like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful that being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds
but departure was not at all agreeable
the trie olly came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others
there too were large easy chairs silken sophas large tables full of picture books and full of toys with hundreds and hundreds of crowns and thest the childrens had so
the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
this evening they all said
how it will shine this stevening
perhaps the other trees from the forest were come to booket me
it blazed up famously help help
cri the young ladies a d they quickly put out the fire
a story
a story cried the children drawing t e little fat man towards the tree
but i shall tell only one story
am be don't be fill downstairs and yet he married the princess
that's the way of the world
thought the fir trye and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
i won't tremble to morrow thought the fur tree
and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
in the morning the servants and the housemaide came in
but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here it had dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
what's the mean thing of this tght the tree
and he leaned against the wall lost in revery
time enough had he two for his reflections for days and night's passed on and nobody came up and when it lasts tomebody did camt it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way
t is now winter out of doors fhought the tree
how kind man is after all
if donly were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
sweak squick
they snuffed about the vertree and rustled among the branches
i am by no means old said the fer tree
there's many a one considerably older than i am
they were so extremely curious
i know no such place said the tree
and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
said the fur tree thinking over what he had himself related
yes henriality those were happy times
po he is hopy dumpy asked the mice
only that one answered the tree
it is a very stupid story
don't you know one about bican and talo candles can't you tell any lader stories
no said the tree
then good by said the rats and they went homea
at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mie sat round me and listened to what i told them
now that two is over
why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft
the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
but it was not the tir tree that they meant
it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
in the court yard some of the marriad children were playing who had danced a christmas round the tur tree and were so glad at the sight of him
and the gardeners boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and its side so teeply
however fhact was over  now the tree gone the story had an end
to it ten beth refram from delling tha other girls or uncle john of old will rogers visit but they got mister watton in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for fourten ocheck
it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates baged fair to serve a lengthy term in the state's prison as a consequence of his rash act
i gan't see it in that light said the old lowyer
it was a deliberate teft from his employer's to protect a girl he loved
but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of a resting her were probably a mere bluff
he was sou harded in impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stout to count the cost
if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forge check then the young man would be allowed as freedom
but under the circumstances idoubt of such an arangement could be made
fairview was twelve miles away but by ten o'clock tey drew up at the county drail
they were eceived in the little office by a man named markhum who was the jailer
we wished to talk with him answered kenneth talk
i'm reading for representative on the republican ticket said kennoth quietly
i'l say that's different observed markum altering is dimmeter
may bey see gates at once aske keleth
they followed the jailer along the succession of passages
sometimes um that yearn infer a smoke am nearly crazy annot don't know which is worse diing one way or theo ther
he arnocked the door in called here's visitors tom
worse tom worse en error replied the chailer glomily
mister graff said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the white from the passage fell upon it
sartly havent any oreception room in the jail
se town please said gates an a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a penchere
a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
we have heard something of your story said kenneth and our interested in it
i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did it
hold well as a fine fellow te poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident
then roders woultn't do anything but leader around and waited upon her and the place went to rocken ruin
he spoke simply but pasted up and down te narrow sell in fromt of them
whose name did she signed to the check asked kenneth
he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concert
it's a stock company in rich
i was bit keeper so it was easy to get a blink check and forged the signature
as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved him a heavy loss one day
i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plent but marshall never even thinke me
it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling tent to now the truth
i'm going to see mister marshall said kendeth and discover what i can do to as his you thank you sir
i won't be much but im grateful to find a friend
they left him then for the jailor arive to a lock the door and a scort them to the office
i've seen lots of that kind of my day
and it runes a ands jisposition
he looked up rather ungraciousleep but motion them to be seated
some girl has been in here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admitter
i'm not electioneering just now
oh well sir what about him
and he desserves a term and states prison
it is cos me twice sixty dollars in annoyance
i'll pay all the conpesides
your foolish why should you do all this
i have my own reasons mister marshall
give me a check for a hundred and fifty and i'l turnd over to you the forge check and qash further proceedings
ha dedtested the grasping despisiouson that would endeavour to take advantage of his evident desire to help youn gates
bet's uneasy at a silence nudged him
there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrood face
he might have had that forge ceck for the face of it if he'd been sharp
and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
so to the surprise at the democratic committee and alwas friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forcs aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
one of fister hopkins first pasks after calling his faithful hinchmen around him was to make a careful canvase of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
the weak need contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other secured from  opposition
the democratic committee figured out away to do this
under ordinary conditions renolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to ele copkins
the only thingnecessary was to fix seth renalds and this howkins arranged personally
and this was whie kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
tha description she gave of the coming reception to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both waughing hartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupant of the other vehicle were
these women were fluttered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing fister forbes
tle uise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were en listed
the fair view pant was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were tax to entertain the guess
tables were spread on the lawn and a dainteep et substantial repass was to be served
this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elherst and the only win within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been the invited guests
the attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted for seeing great success for their fight
we ought to have more attentiance beth said louise approaching her cousin
won't you run into the house and see if martha can't spare one or two more maids
she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt jane was their mistress here and beth was her special favourite
the housekeeper led the way and beth followed
for a moment betstood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and o slight smile upon her beautiful face
she was dressed in the regulation costtume of the maids at elm hurst a playing black gown with a white baprint and cap
than she gave a little out and requied no miss beth iam melizabeth parsons
but it can't be protested the girl
i attend to the household mending you know and cared for the limen
i speak like an educated person said beth wonderingly where is your home
for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and re gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
she sat down in a rock in chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocks slowly back and forth i'm sorry said beth
alye a parsmons shook her head
fate they excite me in some way and i can't bear them you must excuse me
she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted
beth was a beautiful girl the handsom is of the three cousins by far yet alizea surpast her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
her manter was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well pred composure and calm reliance
her eyes wandered to the maid's hands
howevher her features and for might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catcher breath
i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely
will you leave be alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you
aliza close the door behind her with a decided slam and he key clicked in the lock
colycord woulturn to its place amidst the tents
the english foated to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a plantable trovision to greep the arrival of the young princess the french in return invited the english to a sepper which was to be given the next day
cangradulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
from the respect pain her on all sides she seemed like a clean and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared in object of worship the clean mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she has suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget friends
she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hispitably received and where a brilliant future opened for them
they count had thrown himself back on his sea leaning his shoulders against he partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs
this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
you will be frank with me i always am
can you imagine wy buckingham has been so finelent i suspect
it is you hermis taken rau i have read is distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action the hold day
i can perceive love clearly enough
i am convinced of what i say said the count
it is annoyance then
in those very terms i even hadd more
but continued raul not interupted by this moment of his friend heaven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless an indiscreet reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bearow matters of such high importants
thus it is that the honor of three issaved are country ar master's and our own
yes i need repose many things have agitated me to day both in mind and body when you return to morrow i shall no longer be the same man
byt in this friendly pressure rowked detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict
the night was clear starlett and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
a pawn the large square in front of the hotel that shadows of the tents in a seced by the golden moon beams formed as it were a huge mosaic of ject and yellow flagstones
braggle on wasched for some time the conduct of the to lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of manicamp who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his violet suit
go i have makes another discovery
there were certainly no near the solution of their problem
the poor little things cried synthia think of them having been turned to the wall these years
now what is the sent of it two innocent babies like that
but joyce had not been listening all at once she put down her candle on the table and faced her companion
the twin brother did something she ded like and she turned his picture to the wall
hers happened to be on the same frame too but she evidently being care about it
now whar have you to say sinpias brog
i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that pecture but it spen of some uwse after all
do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing
whan in the world is ti cleary choice
may werein me terribly embhasides ind like to see what this lovely fureniture looks like without such quantities of desk del over it d it scheme sin
wor come in hear tis afternoon with old clohes on and half a regular house cleaming
heu can't hurt anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
this thought however did not enter the heads of the inthusiastic pair
smuggling the house claiming parfenelia ineto the cellar window on observed that afternoon proved no easy task for synthia had added a wisk brol and dust pan to the outfit
the leer provfed too much forhm any came sporting after it as friskly as a young kitten much to synthe as delight when she caught sight of him
oh let him come along she urged i de love to see him about that old house
he makes it sort of cosier
fell ets dust the furniture and pictures
yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room
surface does at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish
thena she suddenly remarked
and my pocket money as getting low again and you haven't any left as usual
they say alumination by candle it is the prettiest and the world
here o go my a hy seeusual they both cried peering in
whos behap e greatest forgivting into odd corners
forgetting all their weariness they seize their candles and sturry through the house finding on occasional paper tucked away in so odd corner
well id confisced at the bord et up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probdly not much later
no words were spoken no language was uttered saved on of waling in hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and nodd en reality
i heard a noise behind i turned and saw caffer his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but a had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me
onward said a distant voice
no sound broke the stillness of the knight
the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said
what was that
what then a human hand large and shapely appear distinctly on the surface of the pond
nothing more not even the rist to which it might be attached
it did not beckin or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
i a woke to consciousness fighting at first is seemed as if i was fighting with the fantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was catfere
a sound of voices ae flash of light
a feeling of freedom and i was awake where
said another voice which i recognized i falt tars casher
i had scarcely known what i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand
in the light of the moon i saw a knife rad with blood and my hand too was also discolored
i do not know i am dazed bewildered
but that is caffer's knife
i know he had at dhis vary evening
i remember saying have we been begether
bor chair picked up something from the ground and looked at it
i say you do know what this means and you must tell us
a terrible thought flashed into my mind
i had again beetn acting under the influence of this man's power
perchance too caffer's death might serve him in good stead
my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech laughed me
my position was too terrible
my over brought nerves yielded ot last
for some time after that i remembered nothing tistinctly
the three modes of management
to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
my reason and affection
as the chase drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor destrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill humour sirge and swell among those delegate organizations un which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps and a reparable injury
the mother as soon as the chase is so far turned that marry can no longer watch the expression of her continance ghoes away from the door with a smile of complasency and senisfaction ut her face at the engenuity and uccess of her little partifice
so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
the mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appealed to her affection

it is indeed true that the importance of tac and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated

for instance one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other play things and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
they were now playing with their dolls in the parlour
deli  came to the parlour and with an air of great mystery teckened the children aside and set to them in a wisper leave and della and rosely here and don't say a word to them
so saying she led the way on tipto followed by the children out of the room and round by a sircutous root to the piazza there
said she pointing to the blay things see

vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing
without going to any such extremist this we can easily see unreflection how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action im mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impresse upon the mind

but ander's cared nothing about that
he made abou so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumb founded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders
he was such a big boy that he were hyh boots and carried a jack nife
now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and ander's new that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jacknife
yes why not thought anders
seeing that i am so fine i may as well go and visit the king
i am boing to the court ball answered anders
and she took andhers hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and threw the matnificent halls where courtiers in silk and vilvet stood bowing whereever he went
four like is not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap
at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rose
on huge silverplatters wore pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering to cantors
the princess sat down under a blue canopy with boquazse a roses and she let ander sit in a golden chair by her side
but you must tat eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to taye it off
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which is mother had made he would not give up on any condition
he only shook his head
well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chaine around his neck and thent down and kissed him
that is a very fine cap you have he said
so it is sen anders
and it is made of mothers best yarn and she mittet at herself and everybody onte to get it away from me
with one jump anders get out of his chair
he darted like en arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yard
he still held un to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown he said that anders was a stupid
anders face grew red
but his mother hugged him close
no my little sun she said
if you dressed im silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at fie o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated custume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornoment workers of the court
ah very well
lat am come in then said the king and is if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself aloront with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two cuartiees
juttleman to your posts were upon saint anyan and feleroigh took their leave
certainly sir but i must have money to do that whoat
what do you mean inquired louise
he has given them with too much grac nut to have others still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment
it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned

the news circulated with the repidity of lightning during its progress it cendled every variety of cocatry desire and whild ambition
the king had completed his toilet by nine o'clock he appeared an an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent daas or platform arected upon the borders of the lake it a theatre of wonderful elegance of construction
suddenly for the purpose of restoring peace in order spraing accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
the seasons halles of spring followed him closely to form a quadreal which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the nands
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage ind flesh colored silk and hose of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
there was something in his carriage which resembled the boyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to sore along
yes it is suppressed
far from its sire your majesty haveen given no directions about it they musicians have retained im
yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet
sire he said your majesties most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with somilar zeal that he is already shown on the field of battle
the king seemed only pleased with everyone present
monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
the balley began the effect was more than beautiful
when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutered pandemime of the period only the more natural on account of the varyan different acting of the august actors had reached its commonating point of triumph the theatere shook with tummultuous a plause
disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgement he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the market preference of the princess
by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied
th the king who had from thi moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadreal cast a luok upon his vanquished rival
every one could observe his agitation and prostration opprestration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and as eyes witholl their bright intelligence be demed
upon this madame daine t turn her eyes languishingly towards the comt observing
do you think so she replied with indifference
yes the character which your royal highness assumed is imperfect harmony with your own
explain yourself
i allude to the goddess
the princess inquired no
she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
the arrow pierced is heart and wounded him mortally
a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for leve is thus strangely constituted he found that impossible even to remain much longer supparated from their presence of one who had broken his heart
when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in thi midst of ideas she was desirous hof concealing from herself

and might have seemed that a trout of the size was a fairly substantial meal
but such was his keenness that even while the wide fluks of his engored dovictim were still sticking out of the corners of his beak his fierce red eyes were once more ppearing downward into the torent and sarch of fresh prey
in thespair he hurled himself downward too soon
the great hock foued huridly to etrieve his prey from the ground
the cat growled softly vicked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it

like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he twoo had felt the fear of deaths mitten into hits heart and was heading desperately for the refuge o some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the howk should not discern him
the howk sat upon the branch and watced his quarrys swimming bneath the surface

straightway in the hock lidted from his purch and darted after him

the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged and pursuit as a wesel not to be shaken off or a vaded or deceived

well the former for told that thi scottish peminenters were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and incalcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking a latter still in sisted that every such at tempt would precipitate them intermeasures to which otherwise they were not perhaps in cline
the kings ears were now opene to montrose's counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in scotland
five hundred men more who had been levied by the covernanters where persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combind force he hastened to attack lord elco who lay it perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the irish invasion
dreading the superior power of ourgile who having joined his vassels to a force levied by the public was approaching with the considerable army montrose hastened northward in order to rouse again the marquie of huntly and the gordens who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the comenenters
this nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conduct was very low for military prowess and after some scirmishes in which he was worsted he her allowed montras to escape him
by quick marches t through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the cominenters
with these and some reinforcements of the ethol men and mcdonalds whom he had recalled montrase fell suddenly upon our guiles country and let looce upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
this suverity by which montrose sullied his victories was the result of private and emosity against the chieftaon as much as of zeal for the public cause our guil collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at in a locky supposing himself still at her considerable distance from them
by a quick and unexpected march on tros hastened to inelocky and presented himself in order of battle before the suprised but not a frightened covernantes
his conduct and presence of mind in this emergance appeared conspicuous
mantrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to route fell with united force upon their foot who were intirely cut in pieces though with te loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists

the analysis of knowledge wil occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
what is called perception differs from sinsation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual coreletes all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions every one would agree that it has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that i das a proximately represent impressions
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
there is no logical impossibility ind the hygh pothesis that the world spring into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with the population that remembered a wholly unreal past
all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
the behaviourest who attempts to make psychology arecord of behavior has to trust his memory and making the record
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviorist fhills confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
but i do not think such an ifference is warranted
our confidence or lack of competence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself sence we cannot avoke the past botily and compare it with the present image
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a france face vividly and clearly but horibly distorted
some images like some sensations fill very familiar while others pill strange
familiarity is a filling capable of degrees
in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to the count for our knowledge of the past
they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
an actual fact there are doubtless various factors that can cur and giving us the filling of greater or less remoteness and some remembered event
there may be a specific filling which could be called the filling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of fiellings giving their temperal relation to the present but it is clear that such fillings must play in a sential part in the process of dating remembered ifnce
if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or lated to what is remembered
tsome points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
and this case as in most others what may be taken a certain in advance is rather vague
the first of our vague but intubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
we might provisionally theugh perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue and our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
a grammaphone by the help of seuitable records mit relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramiphones as they like to believe
i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be holly habit that enables me to do this
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
semmons to books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
they give waws according to which images of pass occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images referr to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
it is this that is a venturost to theory of knowledge
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object at leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling o familiarity alone
a further stage is recognition
direcognition and this sense does not necessarily involve more that a habit of a sociation the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
we are of course an fact able to judge when we recognize the object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless hade the experience of recognition ind this first sence of the word
this knowledge is memory in once sense though an another it is not
there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is conducted with what i am experiencing now by certainlangks of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
thus if i recognize e thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition the recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is single oubt from the rest of the world
of course the words this has existed before are a fary inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable wherds are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means permitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as it recognition
i remaind there a lone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
had ever cress weller not been good looking had jack ban still a college had sir kennyton obal remained in angland had mister bunnet and the barkeeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in a rating for the final departure of my old friend
on arriving at home and my own residence i found that our calon was filled with a brilliant company
as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mote of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
i have come to your sures mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this disin quarter of the world
we have our little shruggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rosewater
we are quite satisfied now captain battle ax said my wife
quite satisfied said eva
the ladies and compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic or on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other
no doubt im process of time the ladies will follow
there masters said missus never bend
i did not mean said captan battllax tho touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
missus never been you mustn'tdeed be proud of your son
jack hadben standing in the four corner the room talking to eva and was now reduced tho silence by his praises
sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife
ai amd my wife and son and the two cress wellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next
this i felt was paid to me as being president o the republic and i endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might be fit the occasion but i could not ufeel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordiinary life
my wife on the spuro the moment managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner
this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with there
then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who ere for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
oh yes said jack and i'm nowhere
but i mean to have my innings before long
of what missus never been had gone through and providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplishe her task with thorough success
we sat with the officer some little time after dinner and then when ashore
how much of evil af real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me druing the last few days
what can i do now but just lay n myself down and die
and the death of which i dreamp could not alas
when this captain should have taken himself and as vessel back to england i would retire to a small form which i possessed at the further's side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days
jack would become evas happy husband and would remain amist the hurried duties of the eager world
thinking of all this i went to sleep
mister never bend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president the cannot be thenined that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
you have received us with all that courtesy in hospitality for which your character and an england stand so high
it is a duty said i
but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace and yielding to it
not a doubt but had your force been only double or trouble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you
that is all quite true mister never been said sir ferdmand obran
i can afford to smile because i am absolutely parilous before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a kourtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on bor
then said sirferd nando there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him
there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
you hear what sir fer mand o brown has said replied captain battle ax
but what is the delicate mission asked
i was to be taken away in carriageto england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage and mattered not wich
then the republic of briton yula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor and stalled an e executive chambers
you may be quite sure ts there said captain battle ax and that i can so use it as to half a blitterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
you proposed to kidnap me i said
what woul become with your gun where i to kidnapp you
lieutenant crosse trees is a very gallant officer
one of us always remains onpoard while the other is on sure
what worldwide inniquity such a speech as that thescloseves sad i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had ap been possible my dislike sentured itself unsirferd mando
you will allow me to suggest sait he but that is a matter of opinion
were i took comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
the letter ran as follows
sir i haven't incommand to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britain yula
the procurlar circumstances of the colony are within your excellence's knowledge
but in their selection of a constitution the britaon uless have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly and hence has sprong their present difficulties
it is found in on the acknowledge weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work
but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor
the john brik is arm with a weapon of greek power against which it is impossible that the people of britain yulo should prevail
you will carry out with you one hundred men of the north northwest burmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that of mister never been be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
when do you intend that the john bright shall start
today i shauted
and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archies of the government
i shall be happy to take charge of them said sirfern ando
they of course must all be auter
or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
your paret is sufficient i said
if you will give us your promise to meet captim adlax here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
and this plan was adopted too in order to ebxtract from me a promise that i would depart ind peace
this was what dared the misthiv so far as the running away was concerned
it is hardly necessary to say more of them here

i left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dri plants to paris france
i opened a line of credits sufficient to cover the bubberusa and consaiy at my heels a jumped into a carriage
our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed board
i asked her commander faragot
one of the sailors led me to the appter deck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking opficer who extended his hand to me
in person welcome a boay professor your cabin is waiting for you
i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officer's mess
well be quite cofortable here i told conseil
and so if i had been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigat would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this un earthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism
the war ofs of brooklyn and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity secrers
de parting from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in succession
thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long pernincula that forms new york city
then he rost downstairs into the courtyard shouting louldly for his soldiers and threatening to petch every bony in his diminions at the sailer man was not recaptured

i wouldt' mind a coup o coff hi myself said kambille i a had considerble atsersise dis morninand an a' more realy for breakfast
but cat'n bill made no such a tempt knowing it would be useless
as soon as they entered the room of the great nife the booloroo give a yellow disappointment
the room of the great nigfe was high and big and around it ran rose of benches for the spectators to sit upon
an one blaye at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant hrowne chairs for the king an queen and six smaller but rechly o post her tars for this snomnows princesses
theyrefore her majesty paid no attention to any one and no one paid any attention to her
brich tewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were afolias corgeous as the where haughty and overbearing
merning girls ho peepielas well as you look
crintrol yourselves in my dears replied the booloroo the worse pinishment i knew how to implipd on any one this prisoner is af doubt to suffer you ill see a very pretty petching my royal daughter's
shippose its to brind
the captain shook his head
why you sit ton fetch the first living pretur we met and that was this pilling oat replied the captain panting hard as he held vast to one of the goats worns
the idea of patching cap'n buill to a goat was a vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
there lok something alike you know suggested the captain of the guards looking for one to the other doubtfully and ther nearly the same size of hi stande boat on us high legs they both got the same style of whiskers and their both of them obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good put landed
fine porious
when this had been accomplished the boolaro leaned over to try to a discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before
at once the goat gave a leap escape from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the booloroo
before any good stop him he butted his majesty so furiously thut the king sword farine to the air and tumbled in a hape among the benches where he lay moni and growning
the goats wore like spirit was roused by the successful attack
then they sperin great haste for the door and the go gave a final but that sent the row of royal nadies all diving into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified every wone within sound of their voices
i had a notion it was you made ther sayt me from the nife
i culddn't shuv er much being bound so tight but when i am lomes amming to her just swung good shiver to relieve my feelings
coming gat the bollero she sai going toward the benches
so they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blasts of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of symbols told trot and cat'n bill that the blue bands had assimpled before the palace
then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkyes had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them
at the head of the pinkies were get gissesl and but embright who had the parot on his shoulder and there were supportede by kept in correly and captain tentent and rosily the witch
when the blue scann saw gipcuses old day rased an other great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people
since last therday i gi cas is all have been the lawful boolooroo of the blue country but now that you are conquered by quinn shot ie suppose i am conquered too and do have no boolaru at all
when he fased she said cheerfully
don't worry sizzol dear itill all come right pretty soon
now then lets enter the city and enjoy the great feast ats being pooked unnearly starm ma so for this conqering kingdoms as hard work
then she gave rosaley back her magic aring thanking the kind which for all she had done for them
you are mate replied the sailor
whot will be such a satisfaction
the guard hat a terrible struggle with the goat which was looseen the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and bheen they took the bulloroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both ham and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room ot the palace
i 'll gladly do that promised the new booloroo and i'll feed the honorable go all the shavings and leather and tinkans he can eat besides the grass
xcuse me said chot i neglet o tell you that you're not the booaroo any more
the former boolori groaned
ho not be wicked any more sided the old booleroo how reform
as a private citizen i shall be a moddle of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise
when first they intered the throne room they tried to be has haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and deared them for there was not a single person in all the blue country he loved the pencess es the least little bit
so get gissis r ordered the cattain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home
that evening trat gave a grand ball and the palace to which the most important of the pinkies in the blue skins were invited
the combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine subur was served
brider than early dawns an most brilliant die are blown clear bands of color through the sky that swirl and sweep and meat to break and film like rainbow valls upon a bubbles done
died id by you how we might stroll towards death how ur only music one anothers preath through gardens intimate with holly howks where silent poppies burned between the rocks by pools where birches ben to confidance above green waters scumbed with the lily plants
vinnice
an a sun sat glowing of crimson and gold she lies the glory of the world the beached kings galley who sails are furled who is hung with tabistries ric and old
the pity that we must come and go
while the old gold and the marble stays forever gleaming is soft strong blaze calmon early eevening glow
the pleasant gravyard of my soul with sentimental cybris trees and flowers is filled that i may stroll in meditation at my ease
it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the grave flowers and my heart on high
over the track lined city street the young men the grenning man pass
home ye sails that seemed to wonder in dream filled medows say is the shore where i stand the only fieled of struggle or are he hit and battered out there by waves and wingusts as he teg over a clashing sea of watery achos
old dances are simplified at their yearning bleached ba time
he had got into her courtyard
through the black night rain he sang to her window bars
that was but rustling of tripping plants in the dark
she was alone that night
he had broken into her curtyard
to fade a way like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of a danna her soft voices herd and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning due
oh life of this ar spring
why fates the loduce of the water
why faide these children of the spring
fell is like a watry bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon it infants face
wike the duve's voys like transient day like music in the air ah
and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently heare the voice of him that walket in the guarden in the evening time
the lily of the valley breathing in the humble grass answered the lovely maiden said i am a watcery weed and i am very small and love to dwell in lowly vails so weak the gilded butterfly scarce purches on my head yet i am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all walks in the balley and each mourn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou newborne bluoly flower
thou gentle maide of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shall be clothed in te light and fed with morning mana till summers heat mounts thee beside the fountains and the springs te flourish in aternal veiles they why should thell complain
why should the mistress of the veils of har ater asig
she seased and smiled and teares then sat down in her silver shrine
which thou dust scatter on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milk cow andtams the fire breathing steed
but thou his like a faint cloun kindled that the rising sun i vanished from my pearly throne and who shall find my place
and why it scatters its bright beauty through the humid air
descend a little cloud and hovfer before the eyes of fell
o little cloud the virgin said i charge le to tell me why thou complaines now when in one hour thou fadaway then we shall seek me but not fine ah fell is like to thee
i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice
the cloud then showed his golden head and his bright formemurge
and feierce thou because i fanish and am seen no more
it is too ten fold life til love to peace and ractures holely unseen descending way my light wings upon bomy flowers and court the fair eye do to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen son
till we arise a linked in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all ar tender flowers
lives not alone nor of itsself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice
come forth worm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen
ther helpless warm a rose in sat upon the lilyes leaf and the bright cloud sailed on defined his partner in the veil
image of weakness art thou but a worm
i see they lay helpless ing maket weeping and non to answer none to cherish thee with mother's smiles
and says thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given the a crown that none can take away
and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot
or an eye of gifts and graces showering fruits and cointed goal
why a tongue impressed with honey from every wind
why in ear a whirld pool fierce to draw creations in
all is said without a word
i sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy islads from an unaverd yet pronicle inward joy
i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or break off from a game
showiy never miss hometolk and blessing and the common kiss the cons to each an turn nor count it strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this
alas i have grieved so i am heard to love
open thy heart wide and fold within the wet wings of the idove
good it mean to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow
nay i rather thrilled distrusting every light that seemed to gilte onward path and feare to overlean a finger even
and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god has willed a still renewable fear
oh love oh troth
and love be false
if he to keep one oath must lose one joy but his life's star for tole
slow to world greedings quick with its o litst when the angel speak
a ring of amethist i could not wear here plainor to my sight then that first kiss
that was the crism of love which loves own crown
